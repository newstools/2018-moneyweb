South Africa’s Public Servants Association will meet the International Litigation Group on October 30 as part of the labour union’s bid to recover losses suffered by members of the Government Employees Pension Fund following the Steinhoff International accounting scandal. The PSA and representatives from the Public Investment Corp. will discuss possible participation in global litigation efforts to assist shareholders with the recovery of losses against more than 40 defendants, including Steinhoff, Deloitte, certain banks and multiple current and former Steinhoff directors, the labour union said in an emailed statement Monday. The PIC has more than R2 trillion ($138 billion) in assets under management including those of the GEPF, which account for more than 87% of the total. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
