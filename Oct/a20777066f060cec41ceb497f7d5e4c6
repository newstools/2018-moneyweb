British American Tobacco Plc said revenue from smoking alternatives will miss expectations this year, and that currency shifts are hurting earnings growth and debt reduction. Alternatives to cigarettes are growing more slowly than expected due to weakness in Japan and a product in the US called Vuse Vibe. BAT expects revenue from such products to miss its 1 billion-pound ($1.3 billion) target by about 100 million pounds. While revenue from vaping is rising more than 10%, the company said it’s cutting back on stockpiles for year-end sales in Japan as the market goes flat. Even as consumers switch to vaping and other alternatives, the tobacco industry still has pricing power: BAT’s growth in traditional cigarettes is buoyed by higher prices, which will probably exceed the 5.5% increase of last year. Adverse currency shifts will probably cut full-year adjusted earnings per share by about 7%, BAT also said, although the company still expects to beat its goal of high-single-digit percentage growth in that measure. The London-based tobacco company’s shares dropped as much as 1.3% early Tuesday in London, having lost a third of their value this year amid a selloff of cigarette makers.
