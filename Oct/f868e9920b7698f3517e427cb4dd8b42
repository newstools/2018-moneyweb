Coca-Cola posted sales and profit that beat estimates as the company got a boost from its lower sugar beverages, like waters and diet sodas. It also benefited from higher prices, which it announced earlier this year to offset rising input costs due to tariffs. The higher prices are in response to a duo of key factors: Freight prices have been rising amid a trucker shortage, while President Donald Trump’s aluminum tariffs have made packaging materials more expensive. Chief Executive Officer James Quincey, who took over last year, has been shifting the product portfolio toward healthier drinks as soda consumption declines. This summer, Coke announced a $5.1 billion deal to buy UK coffee chain Costa.  The shares rose as much as 1.6% in early trading in New York. The stock was up 1.3% this year through Monday’s close.
