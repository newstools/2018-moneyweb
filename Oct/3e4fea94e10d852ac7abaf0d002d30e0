South Africa’s jobless rate persisted near a 15-year high in the third quarter as the economy struggles to recover from a recession. Unemployment rose to 27.5% from 27.2% in the three months through June, Statistics South Africa said in a report released on Tuesday in Johannesburg. The median of five economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey was 27.4%.  Africa’s most-industrialised economy hasn’t expanded by more than 2% annually since 2013 and has battled to create jobs. The nation may not be able to achieve a goal of reducing unemployment to 6% by 2030, President Cyril Ramaphosa said at a summit about job creation last month. A report from the country’s National Planning Commission showed reducing unemployment to 21% by 2030 would require economic growth of about 3%, more than triple the forecast for this year. Ramaphosa told delegates at an investment summit last week his cabinet will prioritize creating jobs and reviving the economy. <a href="http://iono.fm/e/619803">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> Private households shed the most jobs in the quarter, employing 30 000 less people.
