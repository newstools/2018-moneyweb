Mediclinic on Wednesday flagged an 8% drop in core profit for the first six months of the year, hit by weaker-than-expected growth in admissions in Switzerland and a slow second quarter in South Africa, sending its shares tumbling. A constituent of London’s FTSE 100 index with a secondary listing in Johannesburg, the private hospital group said group adjusted core profit, or EBITDA, would fall to £214 million ($282 million) versus £232 million in the same period a year ago. Shares in Johannesburg tumbled 18.73% to R72.33 at 08:25 GMT. In London, where Mediclinic has its main listing, shares fell 19%.
