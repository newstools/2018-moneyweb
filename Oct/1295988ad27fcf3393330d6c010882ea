New York state tax authorities have opened an investigation into allegations reported in the New York Times that President Donald Trump and his family created their real-estate empire through “instances of outright fraud,” evading taxes on hundreds of millions of dollars. “The Tax Department is reviewing the allegations in the New York Times article and is vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation,” said James Gazzale, spokesman for Department of Taxation and Finance. The Times reported Tuesday that Trump received vastly more from his father, Fred Trump, than he has previously stated and that his father backstopped his son’s businesses during times of financial distress. In addition, the newspaper reported that the family used a variety of schemes — some potentially illegal — to minimise their taxes. The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The elder Trump was a successful real-estate developer active throughout the city’s boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. The state tax department had previously opened an investigation into the president’s charity, the Trump Foundation. The newspaper said its findings show that Trump’s claims that he’s a self-made billionaire, who had received $1 million from his father, are false. The newspaper said it had reviewed 100 000 documents, including the elder Trump’s tax returns, to calculate that Trump and his siblings had received the equivalent in today’s dollars of $413 million worth of assets. The state’s tax review was first reported by CNBC. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
