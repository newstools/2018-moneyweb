Caterpillar reported third-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates while flagging concern over rising raw materials costs. “In the fourth quarter, price realisation, operational excellence and cost discipline are expected to more than offset higher material and freight costs, including tariffs,” the company said in a statement Tuesday. Caterpillar, an economic bellwether that was expected to report record earnings this year, is feeling the pinch as a trade war boosts metal costs and threatens demand growth for its signature yellow machines.  Caterpillar fell 3.1% at 8:32 am before regular trading in New York. The heavy-equipment maker fell to the lowest closing price this year on Monday.
