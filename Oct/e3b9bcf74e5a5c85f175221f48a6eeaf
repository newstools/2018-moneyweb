More bad news for Tencent Holdings: the Chinese Internet giant has lost its spot as one of the world’s 10 biggest companies. After shedding over $200 billion in market value this year, more than any other company worldwide, Tencent has been replaced by Exxon Mobil in the top of the rankings based on market capitalisation. When its share price hit a record high in January, the Shenzhen-based company was in the top five along with Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon. Tencent returned more than 67 000% from its initial public offering through January, but then turned south this year on a run of bad news including a rare drop in profit and a regulatory crackdown on gaming in China. The stock has tumbled nearly 40% in Hong Kong since January 23, and fell for a ninth straight day Wednesday, on track for its worst ever run. Tencent’s market cap is now $353 billion, while Exxon Mobil’s is $365 billion. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
