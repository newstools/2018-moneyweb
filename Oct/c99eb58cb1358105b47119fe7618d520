The corporate treasury function in all businesses is vital. But rapid change has left many treasurers a step behind, even on core activities like cash management. The cost can be heavy and the risk high. At best the cost could be in the form of unnecessary interest expenses incurred from over-borrowing. At worst, inadequate controls or segregated financial responsibilities could lead to fraud, financial losses and reputational damage. On the other hand, an efficient Treasury operation is a corporate asset. Join Moneyweb and Nedbank CIB at a specialist business breakfast where Ryk van Niekerk of Moneyweb, Dr Adrian Saville of Cannon Asset Managers and group treasurer at Nedbank George Kerby discuss how the modern treasurer can assist their businesses to gain a competitive advantage. The breakfast starts at 7:30 on Thursday 25 October in Sandton. Reserve a seat by e-mailing events@moneyweb.co.za. For more information, contact Carolyn on 011 344 8600.
