Amazon and Alphabet tumbled in the wake of disappointing revenue growth, and it cost investors big money. The losses wiped out $82 billion in stock-market value, a milestone that brings back memories of Facebook’s second-quarter debacle. Amazon fell 7.8% on Friday, erasing about $66 billion in market value. It was its biggest one-day market-cap drop ever, and one of the five biggest for any US stock. Google-parent Alphabet’s 1.8% decline cut its market capitalisation by almost $16 billion. While Friday’s losses reaffirm Amazon’s and Alphabet’s membership in the dubious history book of market-cap collapses, they’re nowhere near taking the individual title. That record belongs to Facebook, which in July became the first US stock in history to shed $100 billion in value in a single session after reporting disappointing quarterly sales and user growth. The stock sank 19% over the course of a single trading session, carving about $120 billion off its value. Amazon’s market cap was $803.3 billion as of Friday’s close. Microsoft($821 billion) reclaimed the title of world’s second most valuable company, behind Apple ($1.04 trillion). Fourth-ranked Alphabet now has a value of $749.1 billion. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
