Social entrepreneur James Steere is last year’s winner of the South African leg of the Chivas Venture competition. He and his wife acted on an idea a few years ago that has expanded into what is now known as I-Drop. The business addresses SA’s water challenge by using filter technology to provide safe drinking water at an affordable price. Every year, the Chivas Venture competition gives away $1 million in no-strings attached funding to social entrepreneurs who blend profit with purpose. Apply for the 2019 Chivas Venture South Africa leg if you are an entrepreneur who is using business to create a better future.
