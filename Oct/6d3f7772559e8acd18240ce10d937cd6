MUA, a Mauritian insurer with operations in four East African countries, plans to acquire small operators to increase its market share on the continent, Chief Executive Officer Bertrand Casteres said. Expanding in fast-growing African economies is part of the company’s strategy to reduce its reliance on the Mauritian market and double the continent’s contribution to profit to more than 50% within five years. The insurer, formerly known as Mauritius Union Assurance, last month increased its stake in Rwanda’s Phoenix Assurance Group to 80%. MUA is more bullish about growing its business in East Africa than in Mauritius, Casteres said in an interview Friday in the capital, Port Louis. “Our priority is to increase our market share in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda by growing the business organically and by acquisition,” he said. “We see growth in the insurance sector ranging from 15% to 20% in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.” Economic growth in those four countries is expected to average 6.1% this year and 6.5% in 2019, faster than the 3.9% and 4% rates expected in Mauritius, according to International Monetary Fund estimates. MUA will target companies that are larger than its current subsidiaries in those markets, he said. The firm has less than 1% market share in Kenya, where it owns part of Phoenix of East Africa Assurance. The country accounted for 5% of income last year, according to its annual report. MUA competes in Mauritius with companies including Swan General, Mauritian Eagle Insurance and two state-owned operators.
