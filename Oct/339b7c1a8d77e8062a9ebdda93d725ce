Pfizer narrowed its full-year forecast as it faces manufacturing challenges at its unit that makes older medicines. Pfizer now predicts revenue for the year to be $53 billion to $53.7 billion, down from its July estimate of $53 billion to $55 billion. The drugmaker’s Hospira business is continuing to struggle. Product shortages at the unit, which has had manufacturing and quality issues in the past, were part of the Pfizer’s cut to its revenue forecast. Pfizer has also been hurt by the strong US dollar in the midst of changing US trade policies. The company said that “weakening of certain emerging markets currencies and the euro” also weighed on results.  Pfizer shares declined nearly 1% to $42.83 at 9:46 am in New York on Tuesday. Through Monday’s close, the stock had gained 19% in 2018, compared to a 1.2% decline in the S&P 500 index.
