South Africa’s Competition Commission has referred beef-processing companies Irvin & Johnson and Karan Beef to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution over cartel conduct. The two companies have been charged with dividing markets in the supply of processed beef products, the market regulator said in a statement on its website. Karan Beef admitted guilt and paid an administrative penalty of R2.7 million ($184 400), the commission said. It is seeking a penalty of 10% of I&J’s annual turnover. Karan Beef’s fine was unlikely to affect its multibillion-rand empowerment transaction with the Public Investment Corp., Business Day reported, citing commission Acting Chief of Staff David Maimela. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
