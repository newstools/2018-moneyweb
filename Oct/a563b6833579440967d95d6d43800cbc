Mark Lamberti, who resigned as Imperial CEO in April, was paid a total of R34.8 million in the year to June 2018 and was able to keep shares awarded under the group’s deferred bonus plan (DBP) and conditional share plan (CSP) until their vesting on September 15. A note in the group’s financial statements for an item not directly related to Lamberti’s remuneration refers to this as a “settlement”. Excluding those which vested last year, these shares are worth over R80 million at current prices. Lamberti famously received no cash compensation in 2014, 2015 or 2016 “consistent with his election to be aligned with the interests of shareholders”. In 2017, his compensation was predominantly in the form of DBP and CSP shares. He was paid just R1.6 million in cash in FY17, with the R5.6 million balance of his total fixed compensation paid in the form of DBP rights. As part of Lamberti’s ‘unconventional’ pay structure, last year the group said the board had “resolved that the company will make R3 million available on an annual basis, that would otherwise have been payable to the CEO of Imperial, for the provision of university education from the second year onwards to the direct descendants of individuals who earn less than R600 000 per annum and have been employed for more than five years.” During the 2017 financial year, Lamberti had a number of DBP and CSP shares vest. These vested on September 18, 2017, at a price of R188.75. At that price, the 60 787 matching DBP shares which vested were valued at R11.473 million. Similarly, the 63 318 CSP shares which vested, were valued at R11.951 million. At the time of his resignation, he retained 246 902 matching shares under the DBP and a further 201 315 shares under the CSP. Using the September 17 closing price of R178.89 (these vested on September 15), these were valued in excess of R80 million at vesting.

The court did not find him guilty of discrimination on the basis of race or gender. In his letter to shareholders in the 2018 annual report, chairman Suresh Kana devotes considerable space to these events and the related issues: “Whereas the circumstances leading to Mark Lamberti’s resignation have been ventilated in the media and the board has made its position clear on the matter, persistently damaging coverage following the High Court judgment requires further comment. The negative impression created in the public sphere does not take account of the priority given by the leadership of Imperial Holdings to accelerating executive development and transformation and aligning Imperial’s employee and leadership profile with the economically active demographics of South Africa. Nor does it fairly reflect the progress made since 2014, the time at which the matter arose that became the subject of the legal action.” He also notes that “Mark Lamberti served Imperial with distinction from March 2014 until his resignation on 30 April 2018 … The board once again extends its appreciation to Mark for his excellent leadership of the group and of a strong executive team who implemented a complex portfolio, organisation, and management restructuring.” This restructuring “culminated in the decision to unbundle Motus, providing it and Imperial Logistics with direct access and accountability to capital markets”. Should this transaction be approved by shareholders at the end of October (as it is likely to be), the unbundling will be completed in November. Lamberti would’ve retired as CEO at the end of February 2019, at the end of his five-year contract. * Hilton Tarrant works at YFM. He can still be contacted at hilton@moneyweb.co.za.
