Jefferies Group agreed to distribute its equity research to institutional investors in South Africa through Standard Bank’s SBG Securities unit. The pact allows the New York-based investment banking firm to add Africa’s most industrialised economy and largest savings pool to a list of alliances including more than 100 analysts covering 800 companies in countries such as China, Thailand, Australia and South Korea, the companies said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The research will be co-branded as Jefferies/SBG Securities Global Research and include economic, market, sector and stock analysis. The South African market has seen rapid growth in the “insourcing of research” and the size of offshore investments, Marc Ter Mors, the head of equity research at Johannesburg-based SBG, said in the statement.
