South Africa’s unemployment rate rose to 27.2% in the second quarter from 26.7% in the first quarter. “The official South African unemployment rate probably will remain close to 27% in Q3, due to weak growth, continued policy uncertainty and a lack of measures to boost employment,” NKC African Economics wrote.
