Here’s what caught our attention on Tuesday: 1. A day before MTBPS The year 2018 was a tumultuous one for South Africans, both politically and economically (and sometimes emotionally). The newly appointed Minister of Finance Tito Mboweni will be delivering the medium-term budget policy statement on Wednesday, in which he will provide an update on how the economy has performed this year and what more will be done to strengthen the economy and haul it out of a recession. Analysts say the markets are quietly optimistic about the budget, others say Mboweni will face heat to get things in order. Read: Markets unfazed with heat on Mboweni before MTBPS 2.
