Hershey tumbled the most in more than two years after the candy company’s third-quarter results and outlook disappointed investors. Revenue amounted to $2.08 billion, the company reported Thursday, compared with the average $2.09 billion projection. Hershey’s margins shrank in the quarter as it faced higher freight and shipping costs. Its adjusted gross margin dropped to 44%  from 45.3% a year earlier. The candy maker has been adding what Chief Executive Officer Michele Buck on Thursday called higher-margin products, with its recent acquisition of Pirate’s Booty maker B&G Foods for $420 million. That followed its purchase of the maker of SkinnyPop popcorn in a push to expand its snacking portfolio. The company already offered snack mixes with chocolate, along with cookie shortbread bars. Buck said in September that Hershey may also look to offload brands that don’t have room for profitable growth. The shares fell as much as 8.3% to $99.15 Thursday in New York, the biggest intraday slide since August 2016. They had dropped 4.7% this year through Wednesday’s close.
