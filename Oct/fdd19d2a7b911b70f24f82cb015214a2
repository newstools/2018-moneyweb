The South African rand firmed against the dollar on Thursday after the greenback was jolted by the worst fall in US stocks in nearly eight months. The rand was 0.71% stronger at 14.67 per dollar at 06:50 GMT, having closed in New York at 14.78. The rand is expected to trade between 14.60 and 14.90 to the dollar on Thursday, NKC African Economics wrote in a note. The rand had been supported by the market’s favourable reaction to the appointment of Tito Mboweni as the new South African finance minister on Tuesday.
