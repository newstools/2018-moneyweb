Here’s what caught our attention on Wednesday: 1. SA, you’ve got a new finance minister The events on Tuesday unfolded in ways South Africa hardly expected. President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed South Africa over the Nene debacle, saying he had accepted his resignation as finance minister, and appointed former Sarb governor, Tito Mboweni as South Africa’s new Minister of Finance. Ramaphosa thanked Nene for his services and leadership and handed the reigns to Mboweni who he says, ‘comes in at a critical time’.

Sacci business confidence The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (Sacci) monthly business confidence index rose to 93.3 from 90.5 in August, and was helped by higher export volumes, new vehicle sales and lower inflation, a survey showed on Wednesday. 3. Tax Ombud picks a bone with Sars The Tax Ombud came forward in saying that it is not satisfied in the way that the South African Revenue Service (Sars) has been dealing with the delays of tax refunds. The 2017/2018 annual report released by the Tax Ombud showed that a majority of complaints reviewed between April 2017 and March 2018 related to refunds. Acting Sars commissioner, Mark Kingon says that issues brought up by the Tax Ombud are being addressed. Read: Tax refunds: There are still issues, Ombud says 4. Newpark Reit results Newpark Real Estate Investment Trust, whose property portfolio consists of four properties, one of which is the JSE building, is reporting an increase in headline earnings per share to 41.10 cents for the six months ended August 31, 2018, compared with the 24.52 cents reported in 2017.

The company has declared a dividend of 24.94 cents per share. 5. Rand update The uncertainty surrounding Nene’s departure was evident in the movement of the rand.
