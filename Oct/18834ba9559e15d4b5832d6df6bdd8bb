The Amazon founder lost $19.2 billion over the past two trading days — the most ever in that time, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — amid a global market selloff fuelled by fears of further trade tensions. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg held the previous record, set in July, when the social-media giant reported revenue and user growth that missed estimates, lopping $16.5 billion from his fortune.  Technology stocks led Monday’s declines, with the Nasdaq Composite Index sliding to its lowest since April. Shares of Amazon tumbled 6.3%, on top of Friday’s 7.8% drop, leaving Bezos with $128.1 billion, down from a peak of $167.7 billion early last month. The $8.2 billion hit he took Monday was the biggest by far on the Bloomberg ranking of the world’s 500 richest people. Mexican telecom tycoon Carlos Slim’s $2.5 billion drop was the day’s second-largest. Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, lost $558.3 million and is now worth $92.8 billion. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
