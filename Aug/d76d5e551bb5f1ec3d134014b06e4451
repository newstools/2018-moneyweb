Wim Rothman, franchisee for the Mugg & Bean outlet in East Rand Mall, has spent his life in hospitality. He was there at the birth of Mugg & Bean more than 20 years ago and has seen it grow to a brand with more than 200 stores. Mugg & Bean was acquired by Famous Brands in 2009, and has accelerated its growth since then. You must have a passion for dealing with people, and be prepared for long hours, says Rothman. But the rewards in terms of personal and financial satisfaction are undeniable. Brought to you by Nedbank Franchising.
