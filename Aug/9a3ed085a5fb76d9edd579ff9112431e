Lender Standard Bankâ€™s first-half profit rose by 5%, helped by a strong showing from its businesses outside its home market, the bank said on Thursday. Headline EPS, the main profit measure in South Africa that strips out one-off items, came in at 794 cents in the six months ended June, compared with 756 cents a year earlier. South African banks have struggled to grow lending at a faster rate in their home market as a stagnant economy, job losses, and high personal debt levels hit investment and spending. But Standard Bank has fared relatively better thanks to its extensive operations elsewhere on the continent, where a rebound in commodity prices has spurred transaction volumes and lifted demand for loans. Non-interest revenue, or income from transaction fees, rose 8% to R22 billion while net interest income, a measure of lending profitability, edged up 1.3 % to R29.1 billion.
