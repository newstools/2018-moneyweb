It’s time you start looking at your orange juice differently because it’s about to undergo a revolution. SA-based biotechnology company Green Cell Technologies has signed an agreement with Brazil-based orange juice producing company, Citrosuco to revolutionise the way orange juice is produced. Green Cell is granting Citrosuco an initial two-year license for the use of its Dynamic Cellular Disruption (DCD) process and Disruptor technology for its orange-related specialty ingredient market. This will give the global juice-making company an advantage in the beverage and manufacturing industry while also increasing its ability to create more products for consumers’ growing appetite for natural goods.

Citrosuco said in a statement that the access to Green Cell’s machinery and intellectual property gives it an opportunity to develop new products while its consumers will benefit from nutritional enhancements that can be unlocked by the technology. Green Cell is known for the unconventional methods it applies in the manufacturing process, and claims to help companies attain higher yields and reduced food waste without taking away the natural goodness of the product. It avoids the use of harmful heat and chemicals in its process. Green Cell CEO Roy Henderson says the agreement with Citrosuco means the two companies can invest in sustainable innovation that aims to provide better foods for more people while minimising any negative impact on the environment. “With the world population growing on a daily basis and the ability to deliver meaningful nutrition diminishing, it is imperative that food processors enter the modern manufacturing paradigm,” he says. The agreement came into effect on August 6, 2018.
