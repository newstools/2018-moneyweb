Listed independent education provider Curro Holdings, released results on Tuesday for the first six months ended June 30 2018, showing an 18% boost in revenue from R1 051 million to R1 242 million. The group’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 31% from R255 million to R355 million, while headline earnings increased by 25% from R110 million to R138 million. The major improvement in the Ebitda margin from 23% to 27% is due to increased efficiencies and capacity utilisation, the group said in a statement. Funding, expansion and acquisitions Curro says that it will invest just over R1.1 billion in the building of new campuses and on existing campuses. It will dedicate R400 million of this amount to build six new campuses: Curro Vanderbijlpark and Edenvale, Curro Academies at Parkdene (Boksburg, Gauteng), Protea Glen (Soweto, Gauteng) and Savanna City (Johannesburg) as well as a Curro Castle at Burgundy Estate (Cape Town). In addition to this, around R700 million will be allocated for expansion plans to Curro Brackenfell, Building Blocks, Curro Heritage House and Windhoek Gymnasium. More recently, Curro acquired Baobab Primary School (Gaborone, Botswana), Cooper College (Douglasdale, Gauteng) and Dot’s Learning Centre (Durbanville, Western Cape). Further acquisitions are being explored. “Curro has a strong balance sheet that comes on the back of prior capital raises and improved profitability. The increasing cash generation improves the group’s ability to service debt, which will be the preferred method of funding going forward,” says Andries Greyling, chief executive officer of Curro Holdings.
