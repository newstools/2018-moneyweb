South African gold producers said on Thursday they had offered annual wage increases of up to 7.2% to underground employees and up to 4.5% for miners and artisans. The four companies involved, Sibanye-Stillwater, Harmony Gold and AngloGold Ashanti and a smaller producer Village Main Reef, have each tabled different offers which are above inflation, they said in a statement.
