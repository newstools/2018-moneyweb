The South African economy has experienced a prolonged period of underperformance reaching as far back as the global economic recession in 2008. Economic data suggests that South Africa has never fully recovered from this period. However, the economy received a renewed wave of confidence when Cyril Ramaphosa was inducted as South Africa’s president. Initially, this wave of ‘Ramaphoria’ was in a large part due to the perception that he could turn around the protracted period of subdued economic performance. But how has the economy really performed since he took office? It is important to note that many aspects of the economy have deeply rooted systemic natures and as a result cannot be expected to suddenly improve in the short term. While this is understood by those who have knowledge of how economies work, the average consumer is concerned by the everyday challenges they face and is therefore more influenced by the short-term in their decisions. Some of the main indicators that consumers are concerned with are economic performance (GDP), cost of living, employment and their income level. Economic performance is the epicentre of numerous other outcomes within an economy as it directly influences the perceptions of not only local citizens but the international community as well. Table 1: SA Economic Performance 2012 – Q1 2018 Year GDP at market price 2012 2.2% 2013 2.5% 2014 1.8% 2015 1.3% 2016 0.6% 2017 1.3% Average 2012 – 2017 1.6% Q1 2018 -2.2% Source: Stats SA In 2010, Pravin Gordhan announced that if South Africa was to create jobs, the economy needed to grow by 7% per annum. The data in Table 1 has fallen well short of this mark for numerous reasons, including global sentiment towards emerging economies. The most recent economic statistics indicate that the South African economy has in fact contracted by 2.2% in the first quarter of 2018. Currently, the South African Reserve Bank forecasts that the economy will grow at 1.2% in 2018, which is sadly below the subdued average we experienced between 2012 and 2017. In April, president Ramaphosa announced that South Africa would send an envoy of top officials on a ‘road show’ to seek foreign direct investment into the economy. This is a much-needed initiative as investment into the South African economy has typically been via the financial markets, which are far more volatile and often based on short term gains rather than true long-term investment. The movements in South Africa’s cost of living are officially measured by Stats SA’s consumer price index (CPI). This figure is one of the more contentious figures in economic reporting as most consumers feel that the number is understated and does not represent the true state of inflation in the country. This reality is often reflected in the wage demands of interest groups and unions during South Africa’s annual ‘strike season’. Table 2 reflects the most recent inflation statistics released in Stats SA’s monthly CPI report. Table 2: SA consumer price inflation statistics Year Average  inflation 2014 6.10% 2015 4.60% 2016 6.40% 2017 5.30% Average 2014 – 2017 5.60% 2018 (year to date) 4.30% Source: Stats SA As opposed to the weak economic performance reflected in Table 1, Table 2 contains better news for South African citizens. The South African Reserve Bank has an inflation target of between 3% and 6%, which was only slightly breached in both 2014 and 2016. Currently, inflation in 2018 is at comparatively low levels when compared to the previous years in Table 2. This is positive news for consumers who have felt the effects of rising prices in recent years. The producer price index (PPI) measures the inflation rate faced by producers of goods and services, and is often thought of as a leading indicator to inflation as producers will pass increased costs on to consumers. Table 3 reflects the inflation rate of final manufactured goods between 2014 and June 2018. Table 3: SA producer price inflation of final manufactured goods Year PPI final manufactured goods 2014 7.50% 2015 3.60% 2016 7% 2017 4.80% Average 2014 – 2017 5.73% 2018 (Year to Date) 4.65% Source: Stats SA Similar to the CPI statistics, the PPI statistics in Table 3 experienced their highest inflation rates in 2014 and 2016, and the year to date is well below the 2014 to 2017 average. This is good news for consumers as it implies that they can expect inflation to remain at lower levels than in the past (at least in the short term). It should be noted however that the PPI for final manufactured goods in June 2018 (latest figure) was recorded as 5.9% which may be cause for concern if it is the start of an increasing trend in this figure. The cost of living affects all South Africans directly and indirectly and this often forms the basis of salary demands during wage negotiations. Recently, South Africa has experienced a wave of protests regarding salary increases. This is not unusual within the SA economy, but what has been different in 2018 compared to previous years is the implementation of the national minimum wage. Salary increase negotiations are always a tricky landscape as employees seek to increase their salaries while employers seek to manage employment costs. The most recent unemployment statistic released at the end of July 2018 indicated that South Africa’s unemployment rate has deteriorated even further to 27.2% which is extremely high by global standards. Interestingly the industry that experienced the heaviest job losses was manufacturing, which lost 105 000 jobs during the second quarter of the year. Whether or not this has a correlation to the increased PPI inflation of final manufactured goods and the imposition of the minimum wage is not clear but is a subject worth debating. Based on the data presented above, it is clear that real meaningful change has not yet found its way into the economy in 2018. Although there are positive signs for consumers when analysing inflation data, economic performance experienced a contraction in the first quarter which has resulted in increased unemployment during the second quarter. These statistics don’t appear to have deterred wage demands during the wage negotiation process – numerous ongoing negotiations are requesting increases well in excess of consumer price inflation. One can only hope that all parties involved will negotiate in good faith and provide South Africa with the stability needed to improve economic performance during the second half of 2018.
