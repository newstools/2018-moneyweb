The Competition Commission was granted an extension of 15 working days to consult on a proposed deal in which a black-investor group backed by Glencore would buy Chevron’s assets in southern Africa. The merging parties — Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six and Chevron South Africa — opposed the extension application to the Competition Tribunal. The extension was granted “to consult interested parties” over the merger, the commission said in an emailed statement. Glencore is supporting black-investor group Off The Shelf Investments as a technical and financial partner, it said previously. Off The Shelf’s investors own the 25% of the southern African business that Chevron doesn’t. The assets include a 100 000 barrel-a-day refinery in Cape Town and more than 800 gas stations in South Africa and neighbouring Botswana. China Petroleum & Chemical, known as Sinopec, finished a regulatory process for its own bid to buy the assets when the Competition Tribunal in March approved a merger between the company and Chevron’s local unit. Off The Shelf has exercised its right of first refusal to bid for the assets. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
