The South African parliament’s portfolio committee on public works withdrew the Expropriation Bill because lawmakers are reviewing section 25 of the constitution to make it possible for the state to expropriate land without compensation. Former President Jacob Zuma returned the bill to parliament in 2017 because lawmakers had failed to facilitate adequate public participation. The ruling African National Congress commented on the bill’s withdrawal in an emailed statement Tuesday. The bill is separate to the review of section 25 of the country’s constitution that’s currently under way. On December 20, the ruling African National Congress said expropriating land without compensation should be among mechanisms to effect land reform, as long as it doesn’t undermine the economy, agricultural production and food security. The Constitutional Review Committee is due to report back to lawmakers soon.
