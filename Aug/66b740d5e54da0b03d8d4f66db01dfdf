Here’s what caught our attention on Monday: 1. The rand continues its falling streak They say if the world sneezes, the rand catches a cold. That seems to be the case over the past few days with the rand plummeting 10% to almost R15 to the dollar. The drop is a result of a massive fall in the Turkish lira which spread across all emerging markets. South Africa’s government bonds also suffered a massive loss on Monday.
