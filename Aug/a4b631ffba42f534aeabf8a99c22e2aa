Transnet said on Monday it would clamp down on unauthorised expenses after uncovering problems with procurement at the state logistics firm. Transnet, which operates nearly three-quarters of the African rail network, the bulk of which is in South Africa, has been investigating allegations of corruption in the procurement of 1 064 diesel and electric locomotives. The firm said during its results presentation that the year had been “characterised by a number of serious procurement related governance challenges which has impacted on the company’s reputation and the ability to attract investment”. Transnet said its board and management were developing an action plan to prevent irregular expenditure, which is referred to by Treasury as expenditure other than unauthorised expenditure, incurred in contravention of existing rules. The firm reported full-year revenue ending March 2018 up 11.3% to R72.9 billion, boosted by an increase in volumes of export coal and container volumes. Coal export volumes it transported by rail for the financial year rose 4.3% to 77 million tonnes, the firm said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 18% to R32.5 billion from R27.6 billion in the previous reporting period. ($1 = 14.6363 rand)
