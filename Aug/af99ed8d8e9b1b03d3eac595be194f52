US stocks ended their four-day winning streak on Thursday as investors sold risk ahead of the long holiday weekend. The broad-based sell-off steepened mid-afternoon in the midst of ongoing trade talks. The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor anxiety, rose to its highest level in over a week. “It makes sense, especially given the run we’ve had, that some investors and traders just don’t want to hold risk going into the long weekend,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, NJ. “It will be interesting to see what shakes out in the markets when everyone comes back from vacation next week,” Cruz added. China kept its tariff dispute with the United States in focus as its commerce ministry insisted negotiations must be based on “equality,” with Washington’s proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods going into effect next month. China’s statement coincided with continuing efforts by Canada and the United States to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) ahead of a Friday deadline.
