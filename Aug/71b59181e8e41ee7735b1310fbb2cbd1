Gold Fields said on Tuesday it plans to slash costs at its struggling South Deep mine, including cutting 1 100 jobs, or around 30% of its workforce. South Deep, the company’s last South African asset, has faced operational obstacles in a tough geological setting 3 km below the surface. The mine made a loss of R337.6 million ($27 million) in 2017. Gold Fields shares opened 3% lower at R47 per share. The bullion producer, which has invested R32 billion in the operation since acquiring it in 2006, said it could no longer sustain losses at the mine, which has missed several production targets despite significant modernisation. “The key challenge has been the difficulty in transitioning the mine from one run with a conventional mining mindset and practices to mining with a modern, bulk, mechanised mining approach,” Gold Fields said in a trading update. The firm also said it expects headline earnings per share for the six months ended 30 June 2018 to be unchanged at $0.08 per share compared with the previous reporting period.
