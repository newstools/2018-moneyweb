South Africa’s ruling party will probably decide at a special meeting of its top decision-making body to disband its North West province executive, two people familiar with the situation said. The African National Congress’s regional leadership has become dysfunctional, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as they aren’t authorised to speak publicly on the matter. The party’s National Working Commission has resolved to call a meeting of the executive committee on Thursday and ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule may make an announcement on the meeting later on Tuesday, the people said. The ANC forced Supra Mahumapelo to step down as premier of the province after violent protests erupted against his leadership. Mahumapelo was a vocal supporter of former President Jacob Zuma and opposed Cyril Ramaphosa becoming leader of the party in December.
