AngloGold Ashanti said it will swing to a first-half profit due to increased production and lower retrenchment costs. The South African gold miner, which is due to report first-half results on August 20, said in a preliminary estimate on Thursday that it expected headline earnings of between R1.2 billion and R1.4 billion for January to June, with headline earnings per share of between 22 cents and 26 cents. That compares to a headline loss and headline loss per share for the same period last year of $89 million and 22 cents, respectively. The turnaround in performance was also due to the absence of once-off, non-cash settlement costs for silicosis class action claims. Anglo said production from retained operations increased by 4% in the first half to 1.578 million ounces from 1.517 million ounces a year earlier. “This is due to strong production improvements from Sunrise Dam, Kibali, Iduapriem, Mponeng and Tropicana,” it said in a statement.
