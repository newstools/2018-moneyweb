The share price of building materials retailer Cashbuild dropped by 3% on Tuesday to R303.61 following the release of its financial results for the year ended June 30. Despite a difficult market with consumers being under severe pressure, the group succeeded in growing its revenue by 5% to R10.2 billion. In the previous financial year revenue was R9.7 billion. This is the first time that revenue has exceeded the R10 billion mark.  Operating profit however decreased by 12% to R543 million. And the total dividend for the year dropped by 9% to 842c. The revenue growth was largely contributed by the 42 news stores (opened after July 2016). The stores in existence before then showed no change in revenue. Cashbuild sells directly to a cash-paying customer base. It currently has 318 stores, including seven DIY stores and 60 P&L Hardware stores. According to Cashbuild CEO Werner de Jager, it was a difficult year with results in the second half being worse than in the first. “Revenue for the stores that were in existence before July 2016 remained at similar levels to last year, with the 42 new stores opened since then largely responsible for the 5% increase,” he said. De Jager said against the background of the depressed economy and pressured consumers, selling price inflation was only 2%. Gross profit increased by 4%, with gross profit margin being slightly lower at 25.2%. In the previous financial year, the gross profit margin was 25.5%. Operating expenses increased by 9%, a third of which can be attributed to existing stores and the balance to new stores. “Nevertheless, the uptick in revenue didn’t compensate for the increased expenses, resulting in our operating profit decreasing by 12%,” de Jager said. Basic earnings per share decreased by 10%, with headline earnings per share also decreasing by 9% from the prior year. De Jager said Cashbuild’s financial position remained solid, with a 14% increase in net asset value per share, from 6 642 cents last year to 7 578 cents. Cash and cash equivalents increased by 19% to R953 million (June 2017: R801 million). During the year, Cashbuild added 25 new stores (11 Cashbuild and 14 P&L Hardware), refurbished 27 stores, and relocated six Cashbuild stores. De Jager said the group will continue with its store expansion, relocation, and refurbishment strategy “in a controlled manner, applying the same rigorous process as we have in the past.” He said the group expects trading conditions to remain challenging in the near to medium term.
