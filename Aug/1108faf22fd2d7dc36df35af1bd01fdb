Retailer Massmart Holdings reported a drop in half-year profits on Thursday due to restructuring costs and weak consumer spending. The company, part of Walmart, had direct costs of R110 million related to the restructuring of some components of its wholesale and discount businesses. Headline earnings per share before restructuring costs were 133 cents per share, a 20% fall from 169 cents per share in the same period a year earlier. Headline EPS is the most widely watched profit gauge in South Africa and strips out certain one-off and non-trading items. Sales decreased by 2.2% to R42 billion despite a fall in the costs of durable goods as consumers limited spending to priority items such as food in light of increased financial pressures, Massmart said in a statement. South African retailers have struggled to lift earnings as elevated household debts, higher fuel prices and an increase in value-added tax squeeze consumer income.
