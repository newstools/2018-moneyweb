South African platinum producer Royal Bafokeng Platinum said on Monday its half-year loss narrowed, with costs related to an impairment and its newly acquired Maseve operations keeping it in the red. The mid-tier producer also warned that “uncertainties over trade tariffs” in the United States and China “may cloud the second half of 2018.” The company reported a headline loss per share of 6 cents for the six months ended June 30, compared with a loss per share of 15.3 cents a year ago. Heps is the main profit gauge in South Africa, which strips out certain one-off items. Ebitda improved by 13.4% and platinum production rose 6.6% to 106 500 000 ounces for the half-year period. Earnings were however constrained by a R25.9 million impairment from feasibility study costs for the Styldrift concentrator plant and R20.5 million in costs related to the newly acquired Maseve concentrator plant and mine. Platinum Group Metals said in September it would sell its Maseve to RBPlat in a transaction valued at around $74.0 million.
