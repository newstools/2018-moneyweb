Copper plunged into a bear market as concerns mount that Turkey’s financial crisis and the US-China trade spat will stymie global economic growth. The red metal for delivery in three months fell 4% to settle at $5 801 a metric ton at 5:52 pm Wednesday on the London Metal Exchange. That’s a more-than 20% drop from its high of $7 332 a ton in June, meeting the common definition of a bear market. Copper has posted four straight daily losses, dropping to the lowest in more than a year. Losses on Wednesday were triggered by a broad retreat in China as the yuan weakened and recent data showed the economy hit a rough patch. The metal’s losses have accelerated as investors flee to the relative safety of the dollar amid Turkey’s financial woes and as concern grows that a US-China trade spat will curb economic growth, hurting demand for raw materials.

BHP Billiton and the union at the world’s biggest mine in Chile agreed to put a new wage offer to a vote by workers, potentially saving the industry from a strike that threatened to disrupt supply at a time of shrinking stockpiles. Comex copper also fell into a bear market on Wednesday. Futures for September delivery declined 4.5% to settle at $2.56 a pound in New York. That’s a more-than 20% drop from a close of $3.30 a pound on June 8. The London Metal Exchange LMEX Index of six metals slid 4%, the most in more than three years.
