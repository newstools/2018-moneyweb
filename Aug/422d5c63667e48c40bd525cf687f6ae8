Parliament on Tuesday summoned Steinhoffâ€™s former chief executive and ex-chief financial officer to give evidence in an inquiry over the accounting scandal at the firm. Former CEO Markus Jooste, who is under fraud investigation by the South Africa police, resigned in December when Steinhoff uncovered accounting irregularities that sent its share price crashing. The former CFO Ben la Grange will also be summoned to give evidence to the Standing Committee on Finance. The hearing will take place on August 29.
