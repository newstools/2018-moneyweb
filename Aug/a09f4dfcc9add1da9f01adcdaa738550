Complaints by consumers about the cellphone industry have dropped substantially, thanks largely to systems improvements by MTN, according to acting consumer goods and services ombud Magauta Mphahlele. Mphahlele on Thursday told a media briefing hosted by the National Press Club that the number of complaints the Ombud’s office received relating to the telecommunications industry (mostly cellphone-related) dropped from 1 142 to 744 year-on-year. The Consumer Goods and Services Ombud aims to resolve disputes between consumers and suppliers through mediation and conciliation. Suppliers who don’t cooperate are referred to the National Consumer Commission for investigation and prosecution. The retail furniture and clothing sectors came in second and third respectively in terms of the number of complaints, and a new trend emerged – online suppliers failing to deliver goods sold to customers, or failing to deliver within the promised timeframe.
