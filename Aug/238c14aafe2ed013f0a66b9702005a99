Steinhoff International former Chief Financial Officer Ben La Grange could be legally ordered to appear before a South African parliamentary committee after declining to attend a scheduled hearing next week. The severity of Steinhoff’s accounting crisis and subsequent impact on public-sector pension funds requires La Grange to be held to account, the finance committee said in a statement Tuesday. It’s requested the Speaker’s office issue a subpoena immediately for the former CFO to answer questions at a parliamentary briefing on August 29. La Grange worked under Steinhoff ex-Chief Executive Officer Markus Jooste, who quit when Steinhoff reported accounting irregularities that triggered a share price collapse in December. The ex-CFO stepped down the following month, but has remained an employee at the owner of Conforama in France and Mattress Firm in the US to help repair the company’s finances.
