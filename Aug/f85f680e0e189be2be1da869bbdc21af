South Africa’s power system was relatively stable early on Wednesday a day after electricity supply was disrupted by protests by workers demanding higher wages, an Eskom spokesman said.

Africa’s most industrialised economy was hit by controlled power cuts on Tuesday after some units went down at Eskom’s stations due to an ongoing wildcat strike and low coal levels. Eskom on Tuesday warned the risk of controlled electricity cuts remained high for Wednesday. “So far, we do have units which have been brought back on service, they are helping us to keep lights on at the moment,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said. “The power system is relatively stable. We will continue to monitor the performance and provide regular updates on the status of the power system.” Eskom was also forced to implement controlled electricity outages in mid-June after workers protested over wages. Eskom also implemented such measures, known locally as “load shedding”, in 2015, denting economic output. Last week Eskom said it was considering cutting staff and selling assets after falling to a R2.2 billion loss.
