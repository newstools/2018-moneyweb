MTN Group, Africa’s biggest mobile operator, reported a 7% decline in half-year profit on Wednesday due to a lower contribution from associates and joint ventures. Headline EPS, the primary measure of profit in South Africa that excludes certain one-off items, came in at 215 cents in the six months through June compared with 231 cents a year earlier. MTN, a poster child of post-apartheid South African commercial success, said the results were negatively affected by a hefty 66% drop to R197 million in contributions mainly from its joint venture in Iran and a widening loss in its e-commerce joint venture, Africa Internet Holdings. MTN is in the middle of a strategic overhaul that includes branching out of basic telecoms services into music streaming, mobile banking and e-commerce and is reviewing its presence in markets where it not a major player.
