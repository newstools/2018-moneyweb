Former Steinhoff chief financial officer denied any wrongdoing in an accounting scandal that has rocked the South African retailer, he told a parliament committee on Wednesday. “From my side, I also do not think I did anything deliberately wrong,” said Ben Le Grange, who stepped down as CFO in January to focus helping the group plug a liquidity gap. He was suspended from that role two weeks ago.
