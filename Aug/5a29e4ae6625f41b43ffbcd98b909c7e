Classic 1027 in Johannesburg and Fine Music Radio (FMR) in Cape Town, have announced exciting plans for a partnership to broadcast the highly successful Classic Business show with Michael Avery to both Gauteng and the Western Cape. Avery is a distinguished financial broadcaster and journalist. Classic 1027 covers the greater Gauteng region and FMR covers greater Cape Town, Fish Hoek, Noord Hoek, Atlantic Seaboard, Hout Bay, Llandudno, Paarl, Somerset West and Stellenbosch. Classic 1027 CEO, Lyndon Johnstone, says the partnership is aimed at establishing Classic Business as the pre-eminent financial radio show in South Africa. “It is about creating a credible business platform that delivers a high net worth audience to advertisers,” says Johnstone. The syndicated show will launch in Cape Town on August 1. “Being at the coal face of the economy and discussing the markets, getting to pick the brains of the country’s finest business people, economists and thought leaders is a privilege and I am naturally thrilled to be able to extend this dialogue to the Western Cape,” says Avery. “It’s also a huge responsibility, considering the delicate nature of the discourse between business, government and labour and Michael Avery has a unique gift in being able to rise to this challenge and sustain this debate,” adds Mark Jennings, MD of FMR. South Africa’s future is inextricably linked with the performance of our economy and the team is relishing the opportunity to facilitate the business conversation and unpack it for a financially savvy, sophisticated, discerning and above all engaged audience across the countries two major metropoles.
