US stocks rebounded on Thursday with the Dow posting its biggest percentage gain in over four months, as positive earnings and waning trade jitters buoyed investor confidence. A broad rally pulled all three major US indexes higher following Wednesday’s sell-off. Walmart Inc shares jumped 9.3% after the world’s largest retailer topped earnings estimates and posted its best same-store sales growth in a decade. Easing trade tensions gave relief to tariff-vulnerable industrials, which led the Dow Jones Industrial Average’s advance. Boeing and Caterpillar ended the session up 4.3% and 3.2%, respectively. The S&P 500 industrial sector gained 1.2%. Escalating tariff rhetoric cooled down on news that Beijing will send a delegation to Washington to help resolve the growing trade conflict between the world’s two largest economies. “The market’s getting a boost with some prominent companies coming in with some decent earnings, such as Walmart,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “But I think this also shows the schizophrenic nature of the market when short-term market action is pegged so closely to trade wars and tariff talks, especially with China.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 396.32 points, or 1.58%, to 25 558.73, the S&P 500 gained 22.32 points, or 0.79%, to 2 840.69 and the Nasdaq Composite added 32.41 points, or 0.42%, to 7 806.52. All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 ended the session higher, with telecom and consumer staples posting the largest%age gains. Second-quarter reporting season is winding down. With 463 of S&P 500 companies having posted earnings, 79.3% have exceeded analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cisco Systems Inc stock rose 3.0% after beating Wall Street revenue and profit targets. Cyber security firm Symantec Corp ended a five-day slide, advancing 4.6% after hedge fund Starboard Value LP bought a 5.8% stake in the company. Among losers, shares of J.C. Penney Co Inc posted an all-time closing low, plunging 27.0% after it posted disappointing results and forecast a worse-than-expected full-year loss. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.97-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.40-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 33 new 52-week highs and four new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 69 new lows. Volume on US exchanges was 6.39 billion shares, compared with the 6.53 billion-share average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.
