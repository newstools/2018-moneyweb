Steinhoff International ex-Chief Financial Officer Ben La Grange laid the blame for the retailer’s accounting crisis firmly at the feet of departed leader Markus Jooste, saying his former boss influenced third-parties that conducted invalid deals. In his first public comments since being suspended by the company last week, La Grange said Steinhoff’s financials were corrupted by inflated profit contributions from various groups as well as transactions with related parties. He didn’t admit to any personal malpractice, telling lawmakers he didn’t “deliberately do anything wrong.” Jooste quit the owner of Conforama in France and Mattress Firm in the US when the South African company reported accounting irregularities in December, triggering a share price collapse. He’s since been referred by Steinhoff to a local police unit, who are investigating charges of fraud related to the company. La Grange stepped down as CFO in January, but remained on the payroll as a consultant before his suspension.
