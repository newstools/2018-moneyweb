You are about to fly to Germany, your boss has asked for a draft of the presentation you thought you would complete on the plane, you still have a sales meeting to attend, your husband wants to go out for dinner and you haven’t packed yet. At this point, SAM comes alive on your phone: “Lufthansa is open for online check in. Would you like your reference number?” SAM then automatically populates the mobile check-in with your data and gives you a handy weather update – it’s unseasonably cold in Berlin. This is SAM, or Smart Assist Mobile application, the chatbot developed by FCM Travel Solutions, the corporate travel arm of the Flight Centre Travel Group – and it’s making travelling much easier for FCM’s corporate clients. “Business travel sounds fun and exotic, but for those who are travelling regularly it’s far from glamorous,” says Lloyd Barkhuizen, FCM’s head of sales for Middle East and Africa. “We have introduced artificial intelligence – AI – into our processes to simplify the travel experience for our clients.” At its core, AI programmes computer processes to understand and mimic the human brain. While there are many fields within AI, two that are commonly used for everyday applications are natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. NLP helps computers to understand human speech and typing. Machine learning refers to computer programmes that learn from new information or data without having to be explicitly programmed. Together, they enable computers to respond to specific questions or requests – and to improve the relevance of responses over time. The travel industry is ideally suited to AI when one considers the huge amount of information that travel companies hold, including traveller profiles, activity history and airline and hotel preferences. Although people may not be aware of it, it’s AI that helps you book flights, hotels and rental cars online at the lowest possible price, and which acts as a virtual assistant to help you plan a trip. It’s also AI that powers the recommendation engines in the websites of online travel agents such as TripAdvisor, Expedia, and Booking.com. They simply crunch information relating to your previous choices or those of other similar travellers in order to make recommendations. Corporate travel companies like FCM are now also incorporating AI into their processes, recognising that this is a way to add value and gain a competitive advantage over the competition. “When our clients land at an airport, SAM directs them to the correct carousel and updates them on their transfer options,” says Barkhuizen. “The more our clients interact with the app, the more it learns, adapts and improves its recommendations. For instance, SAM now knows that I love Thai and fusion food. Recently, on a trip to London, it popped a message on my phone telling me that the Mango Tree was 500m away and did I want to make a reservation?” AI is not just beneficial to travellers but to service providers too. The Hilton Hotel famously unveiled its robot concierge Connie in 2016. Connie provides recommendations for restaurants and attractions as well as information on the Hilton group and other hotels. On the flipside – in 2017, AI could have warned United Airlines ground staff that flight 3411 was fully booked and that the flight crew who wanted ‘jump seats’ would push the number of passengers over the limit. Instead, when no passengers volunteered to get off the plane, aviation security officers forcibly removed passenger David Dao, a doctor, causing a media storm and public relations nightmare. SAM and other AI solutions are still evolving, says Barkhuizen, and in fact have a lot further to go. “Innovation is important to us,” he says. “We have innovation labs in Barcelona, Boston and Brisbane. There is no doubt that the next wave of AI will open up other opportunities to improve the traveller experience. We think it will simplify travel decision-making and planning, shorten the buying process, help travellers avoid travel disruptions, and increase the uptake of loyalty programmes.” The million-rand question is whether AI-powered technology will make travel consultants redundant. “No, we think that’s unlikely,” says Barkhuizen. “We see AI taking on mechanical tasks and freeing up agents to add value. For example, SAM doesn’t replace the human touch entirely and cannot do so because business travel is about people.” Brought to you by Flight Centre Travel Group.
