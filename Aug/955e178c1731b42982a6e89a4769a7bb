MTN’s unit in Ghana raised 1.1 billion cedis ($236 million) as the wireless carrier sold about a third of the shares it made available in an initial public offering, according to a document seen by Bloomberg. MTN, Africa’s biggest mobile-phone company by subscribers, sold 1.5 billion shares of the 4.6 billion shares offered at 75 pesewas each in a sale that ended last month, showed the document. The shares will be listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange with trade due to start September 5, according to the sale’s prospectus. Pala Asiedu-Ofori, a senior manager for corporate services at MTN Ghana, declined to comment when contacted by mobile phone. The Johannesburg-based company embarked on the sale to meet conditions agreed to with Ghana’s government in 2015, when it acquired the right to use fourth-generation spectrum, a high-speed mobile data carrier for customers. Even though MTN failed to sell all the shares on offer, the sale is more than three times bigger than the previous biggest IPO in Ghana, when Agricultural Development Bank raised 326 million cedis in December 2016 MTN has set 10% of the target as the minimum requirement to complete the sale.
