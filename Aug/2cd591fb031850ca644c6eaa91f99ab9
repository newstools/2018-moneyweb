Imperial’s’ full-year profit could rise as much as 16% on lower foreign exchange losses and financing costs, the South African vehicles importer said on Friday. Its headline earnings per share (Heps) for the year to June 30 is expected to rise to between 1 520 and 1 615 cents from 1 390 cents a year earlier. Heps strips out certain one-off items and is South Africa’s most widely watched profit gauge. Imperial shares were down 3.18% to R207.34 at 08:24 GMT after its profit outlook disappointed investors. “The numbers were a bit of a miss and below the market expectation,” said Greg Davies, an equities trader at Cratos Capital.
