The South African Weather Service said on Monday that it saw an El Nino weather pattern developing during the region’s winter and spring but it was too early to forecast if it would last into the summer growing season. The last El Nino was linked to a severe drought that hit crop production and economic growth across southern Africa, and the region is still emerging from its affects two years later.
