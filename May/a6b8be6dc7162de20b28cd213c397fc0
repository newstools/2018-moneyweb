South Africa’s trade department and labour unions said on Wednesday the US decision not to grant Pretoria an exemption from steel and aluminium tariffs could speed up job losses in manufacturing and mining. Countries including Canada, Mexico, Australia and Brazil were exempt from the tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, proclaimed by US President Donald Trump in March. South African exports of aluminium products are annually about 1.6% of total US aluminium imports. The trade department said on Tuesday it was disappointed and concerned that South Africa was not granted an exemption from the duties and described the US decision as “unfair”. “It is important to note that some of the exempted countries are the biggest exporters of steel and aluminium to the United States,” the department said. The Federation of Unions of South Africa (Fedusa) said in a statement that the decision “will only accelerate job losses in the manufacturing and mining industries” – key pillars of the economy of Africa’s most industrialised country. South Africa’s scope to invest in infrastructure has been curbed by weak public finances due to sluggish economic growth, revenue shortfalls and costly bailouts of state-owned companies. Job cuts are a thorny issue in South Africa, which is faced with near record unemployment of about 27% and subdued growth in mining and manufacturing.
