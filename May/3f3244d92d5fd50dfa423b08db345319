Currencies of developing nations have been under pressure after the dollar started a relentless ascent in mid-April and US Treasury yields climbed above the psychological 3% threshold. Adding to their woes was Trump’s decision on Tuesday to pull out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, hurting risk appetite and sparking worries about fresh tension in the Middle East and global oil supplies. “With both oil price and rand volatility likely in the traditionally more risk averse period in the middle two quarters of the year, South Africa could see even more rand weakness if Trump heats up the rhetoric further,” Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop said. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose 6.5 basis points to 8.455 percent, reflecting weaker prices. In the equities market, the Johannesburg All-Share index climbed 0.43% to 57,915 points, while the Blue chip Top-40 index rose 0.54% to 51,273 points.
