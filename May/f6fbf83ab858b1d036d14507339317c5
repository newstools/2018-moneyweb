Christo Wiese, Brait SE’s biggest shareholder, has reduced his role at the investment company as he gears up for a legal battle with scandal-hit South African retailer Steinhoff International Holdings NV. The billionaire is suing Steinhoff for R59 billion to recoup losses incurred when the retailer’s share price crashed after the company reported a hole in its accounts in December. The legal claim partly hinges on the cancellation of a 2014 agreement in which Wiese sold clothing chain Pepkor to Steinhoff, which eventually led to the 76-year-old becoming the largest shareholder. That deal also required Brait to sell a Pepkor stake. Wiese quit as a non-executive director of Brait’s investee company, UK retailer New Look, and as non-executive chairman of Brait South Africa, citing time constraints. He will remain a non-executive director and has appointed his son Jacob as an alternate, San Gwann, Malta-based Brait said in a statement Wednesday. Wiese, who owns more than a third of Brait, said last week that the move against Steinhoff is to ensure he’s part of the retailer’s restructuring talks. Steinhoff’s stock has crashed more than 95% while Wiese’s wealth has slumped to $2.1 billion from more than $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
