President Cyril Ramaphosa said the country needs to take extraordinary measures to boost growth, following years of stagnation in Africa’s most industrialised economy. The government will push ahead with plans to expropriate land without compensation, and will ensure the policy results in economic empowerment, Ramaphosa said at event organised by the ruling African National Congress in Johannesburg. Ramaphosa won control of the party at a congress in December and was named president in February after the ANC forced Jacob Zuma to resign from the post. The president said he expects the ANC to remain united and that he doesn’t expect a breakaway by disgruntled members. His comments follow reports that Zuma supporters intended forming a new party. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
