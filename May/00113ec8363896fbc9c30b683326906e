Lafarge Africa Plc, the continent’s second-biggest producer of cement, plans to cut debt in the next two years as it seeks to boost profit before resuming expansion, the company’s chairman said. The company expects its leverage ratio, which measures the level of debt incurred by a business against its assets, to drop to between 60% and 70% “over the next 18 months,” from more than 100%, Mobolaji Balogun said in interview in Lagos. It sees earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization more tolerable at about $200 million this year. “As soon as the debt becomes more comfortable, we don’t sit there, we will put the foot down on the next round of expansion,” he said. The African unit of Switzerland-based LafargeHolcim wants to take advantage of improvements in the Nigerian economy and a recovery in South Africa to expand and boost profit. Its total debt dropped to about $600 million from more than $1 billion after using funds, including the proceeds of a 131 billion naira ($361.7 million) rights offer, to curb liabilities, he said. The company plans to raise an additional 100 billion naira when the need arises, Chief Financial Officer Bruno Bayet said in April. Lafarge incurred debt to expand capacity at its cement plant in Calabar, southeast Nigeria, and plans to add more production in the short-to-medium term to plants in the southwest and the north, according to Balogun. The Nigerian economy expanded 1.95% in the three months through March from a year earlier, after contracting in 2016. It is forecast to grow 2.1% this year by the International Monetary Fund. South Africa’s central bank expects the economy to expand by 1.7% this year from an earlier forecast of 1.4%. © 2018 Bloomberg
