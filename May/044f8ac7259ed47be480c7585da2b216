South Africa’s Pioneer Foods Group reported a 26% rise in half-year earnings on Monday while operating profit jumped 36% on volume growth and improved maize procurement. Pioneer, which uses maize in many of its food products, said adjusted headline earnings per share rose to 320 cents from 253.4 cents. HEPS are adjusted for the impact of the share-based payment charge of the firm’s black empowerment transaction, related hedge and for one-off merger and acquisition costs. Adjusted operating profit jumped 36% to R949 million. Group turnover, however, marginally decreased by 3% to R9.9 billion ($775.08 million), largely due to price deflation in soft commodities, chiefly in maize and to a lesser extent, wheat and rice, it said in a statement.
