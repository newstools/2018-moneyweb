South Africa’s sovereign debt is assessed as junk and while it could stay there for a while, it’s not getting worse. S&P Global Ratings, which has the nation’s rand debt at one level below investment grade and the foreign-currency debt a step lower, is scheduled to announce a review of its assessment on Friday. After a change in leadership, the country’s prospects are much more positive than when S&P cut the ratings in November, and the company said in March the rating may have bottomed out.
