South African power utility Eskom said on Friday it had evacuated all contractors at its Kusile power station following a violent pay-related protest. Eskom, which has in the past been forced to impose power cuts due to insufficient supply, is scrambling to revamp its ageing plants and is expected to complete construction of all six units at the Kusile coal-fired plant by 2023. Eskom said it had evacuated all contractors when a violent protest broke out at the power station in the eastern Mpumalanga province over a bonus payment dispute. “We had to get everyone to leave our site so we can ensure there is safety there and we are expecting all of them to be back on Monday,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said. Twenty-seven protesters were arrested on charges of public violence and malicious damage to property after four vehicles were damaged during the protest, Mpumalanga police spokeswomen Colonel Mtsholi Bhembe said. Construction at the site has stopped, but power generation at the online units has not been disrupted, Phasiwe said.
