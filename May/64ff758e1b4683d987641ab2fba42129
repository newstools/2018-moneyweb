South Africa will struggle to raise the tax revenues needed to reduce a budget deficit and support fragile economic growth due to ongoing problems in tax administration, the National Treasury’s Director General Dondo Mogajane said on Wednesday. “Growth wasn’t what it should have been last year and it won’t be for a while. Tax revenue faces challenges from both the economy and from tax administration, and raising R60 billion in one year is going to be a tall order,” Mogajane said, referring to the amount needed to narrow the budget deficit.
