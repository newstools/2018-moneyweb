Wall Street edged lower on Tuesday, weighed down by technology and consumer discretionary stocks, while investors awaited President Donald Trump’s decision on the Iran nuclear deal. Trump will announce on Tuesday evening whether Washington will withdraw from a deal that eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. A US withdrawal would tighten economic sanctions on Iran, curtailing the country’s oil output that could bolster this year’s 13% rally in the commodity. Crude prices were down more than half a% – easing from 2014 highs, which had boosted Wall Street in the past two sessions. The S&P energy index was down 0.9% on Tuesday, but remains a top gainer in the quarter, thanks to rising oil prices. “(The Iran issue) has been so well covered, it’s probably all in the price by now. And most recent commentary seems to be that after all the bluster, he may only partially withdraw from the deal,” said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.
