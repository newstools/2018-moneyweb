South Africa wants to attract more investment from pension funds based in other countries on the continent as part of a drive to boost growth and employment, President Cyril Ramaphosa said. “I am particularly interested in getting African pension funds to invest in South Africa,” Ramaphosa told reporters in Cape Town. “A number of African countries have large pension funds that could be invested here in South Africa. As the amount of money increases and floods in it will lift all boats and reduce the number of unemployed.” © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
