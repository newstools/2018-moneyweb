South Africa will likely harvest 12.91 million tonnes of maize in 2018, bang in line with market expectations, the government’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Tuesday. The 2018 harvest is 23%  lower than the record 16.82 million tonnes harvested in 2017 after favourable weather conditions boosted yields, surpassing the previous record of 14.656 million tonnes set in 1981. The CEC’s latest estimate is 0.6% higher than the 12.826 million tonnes it forecast in April, mostly because of better yields in the Free State and North West provinces. The CEC forecast was spot on with a Reuters’ poll that pegged the harvest at 12.9 million tonnes. The 2018 harvest is expected to consist of 6.701 million tonnes of the food staple white maize and 6.207 million tonnes of yellow maize used mainly in animal feed, the CEC said, in its fourth production forecast for the 2017/2018 season.
