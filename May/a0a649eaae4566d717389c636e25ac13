Steinhoff International said it expects to report a net loss for the first half of 2018 as the scandal-hit South African retailer sifts through the wreckage after reporting a hole in its accounts five months ago. Advisory fees related to legal issues, restructuring costs and investigating the financial irregularities have pushed the owner of Conforama in France and Mattress Firm in the US into the red, the company said in a statement Friday. Impairments and losses taken on asset disposals have also weighed on the retailer’s bottom line, it said. The update comes as Steinhoff Chairwoman Heather Sonn leads her executive team at a crucial meeting with creditors in London about how to reorganise more than 10.4 billion euros ($11.8 billion)/(R156 billion) of debt. It’s “essential” that an agreement is reached “as soon as possible,” the company said in the statement. Steinhoff has been selling off assets to boost liquidity but has reached the point where that strategy is unsustainable. The company has hired PwC to probe its accounts, with a conclusion expected by the end of the year. In the meantime lawsuits are mounting, with ex-Chairman Christo Wiese suing the company for R59 billion ($4.6 billion). The shares rose 8.7% to 0.12 euros in Frankfurt. The stock has plunged more than 95% since the scandal broke in December.
