South Africa‘s consumer inflation jumped in April as a higher rate of value added tax and a sharp increase in fuel prices wiped away the previous month’s dip in prices. Headline consumer inflation quickened to 4.5%  year-on-year in April from 3.8% in March, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to quicken to 4.7% on a year-on-year basis following a 1% increase in value-added tax which came into effect on April 1. The statistics office said the increase was driven by higher taxes on specific products, part of government’s plan to boost falling revenues that have seen the budget deficit widen and raise the risk of credit ratings downgrades. “Much of the increase was a result of price rises in product groups that attract specific taxes, namely alcohol, fuel and sugary drinks,” Stats SA said. “Motorists in particular have felt the pain.” Government said in December it would begin collecting a levy of 2.1 cents per gram of sugar on drinks where sugar content is above 4 grams per 100 millilitres. Fuel prices on the other hand have risen by 9% over the past 12 months. The inflation data saw the rand weaken briefly by 1.11% to 12.7050 per dollar before retreating back to its level before the data release. The Reserve Bank (SARB), which sees inflation above 5% in the medium term, is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 6.5% at the conclusion of Thursday’s policy meeting. Central bank governor Lesetja Kganyago said this month while price-growth was under control, it is too early to declare victory in its pursuit to anchor inflation expectations at the midpoint of the 3-6% target range.
