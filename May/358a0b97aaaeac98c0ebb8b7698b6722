For Daphne Mashile-Nkosi March 16 this year was not only significant as the day that production started on her Kalagadi Manganese mine. For her, it was also the day that she was handed the power and voice to empower women in the mining industry. While it may be linguistically frowned upon to refer to a person in mining as ‘dynamite’, it’s more than appropriate in Mashile-Nkosi’s case. Since her early days as a social worker this woman has blasted through the barriers of political injustice, poverty, deprivation, educational disadvantage, racial inequality, extreme gender discrimination and personal tragedy. She has emerged victorious, alongside the women who she has, and continues, to empower. In this Quick Insight, extracted from a full-length, in-depth interview, Mashile-Nkosi shares her unique, personal brand of business leadership; her approach to BEE and her focus on sustainability in her mine.

The interview draws on the person’s life, failures and the lessons they have learnt on their journey to the successful leadership positions they hold today.
