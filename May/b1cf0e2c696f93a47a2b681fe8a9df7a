MSCI released the list of 234 domestically listed Chinese companies that will be added to benchmark equity gauges from next month. ICBC A and China Construction Bank were among the additions, MSCI said in a statement. Inclusion spread across two trading days in June and September, is expected to channel around $17 billion in passive funds into the world’s second-biggest equity market, the index compiler has previously estimated. While Chinese stocks with New York and Hong Kong listings — such as Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings — have long been on MSCI’s global gauges, international retirement plans, endowments and exchange-traded funds will be forced to buy the nation’s yuan-denominated shares for the first time. Still, the initial impact will be mild with the new additions squeezed into a 0.39% weighting on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. © 2018 Bloomberg
