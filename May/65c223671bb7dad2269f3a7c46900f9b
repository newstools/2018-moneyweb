The new Eskom leadership is looking for a hands-on person to assist with the turnaround of the crippled utility and hopes to fill the newly-created post of chief operating officer (COO) as early as July. Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe has confirmed that the COO will be second in charge after the CEO, but with a more technical and operational focus. Cabinet is expected to consider proposed names for the positions of Eskom’s permanent CEO and CFO later this week. If approved, their appointments will be formalised. Phakamani Hadebe is currently acting as CEO and Calib Cassim as CFO.
