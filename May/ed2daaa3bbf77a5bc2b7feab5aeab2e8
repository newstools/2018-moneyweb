The drought in South Africa’s Northern and Western Cape provinces is billed as the worst on record, with Cape Town residents forsaking baths in favour of 90-second showers. At least the wine is getting better. Drier weather meant fewer pests damaging vine leaves in the world’s eighth-biggest wine producer and the warm temperatures helped boost the quality of the 2018 vintage, according to Vinpro, which represents 2 500 wine producers and cellars in the local industry of R36 billion annually. Varietals ranging from sauvignon blanc to pinotage, a local hybrid of pinot noir and cinsaut, have benefited. “Greater variation between night and day temperatures during the ripening stage gave the colour and flavour formation a further boost, which are indicative of remarkable quality wines,” Vinpro said. Still, the three-year drought has left a toll. The harvest is expected to fall 15% to 948 million liters, resulting in an estimated 8% to 11% increase in prices. For consumers around the world who enjoy the 20 million glasses of South African wine drunk daily, that may be a price worth paying.
