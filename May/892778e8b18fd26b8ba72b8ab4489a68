The rand recovered on Thursday, firming more than 1.5% against the dollar as the greenback fell after weaker-than-forecast US inflation data pared market expectations of a faster interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve. At 1508 GMT, the rand traded at 12.36 per dollar, 1.51% firmer than its close on Wednesday, rebounding after three straight sessions of losses. The dollar edged away from 2018 highs on Thursday as US consumer prices increased less than expected in April, paring traders’ optimism inflation is accelerating which would allow for faster Fed interest rates hikes.

The equities market also ended in positive territory as world stocks hit three-week highs with rising oil prices lifting energy counters.
