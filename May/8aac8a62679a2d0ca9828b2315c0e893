The rand steadied against the dollar on Friday, failing to build on gains in the previous session, while stocks rose as bourse heavyweight Naspers recovered ground. At 1515 GMT the rand was trading at 12.58 per dollar, not far off its close of 12.58 on Thursday. However, it was on track for a 2% decline over the week. It was amongst the worst performing emerging market currencies in April and remains on the back foot in May with the dollar lifted by rising US Treasury yields to its highest levels this year against a basket of currencies, despite disappointing US employment data for April. “We need to ask ourselves whether the renewed strength of the greenback is just a clearing out of stale short positions or whether it is a fundamental shift in the trajectory of the US dollar,” Rand Merchant Bank analyst Michelle Wohlberg said. South African government bonds weakened, with the yield on the benchmark due in 2026 up 1.5 basis points to 8.345%. On the bourse, the benchmark Top 40 Index rose 0.92% to 50 408 points, while the All Share Index gained 0.65% to 57 273 points. Naspers closed 4.88% higher at R3 019.33, after dropping more than 4% on Thursday following a fall in China’s Tencent Holdings, in which it is a major shareholder. Gold and platinum miners, however, were under pressure following weaker precious metal prices, with the gold mining index falling 2.72%. “The strong US dollar and mixed economic data kept the pressure on emerging stocks. Mining and industrial shares posted the heaviest losses this week.” NKC African Economic said. The biggest faller was Dis-Chem Pharmacies, dropping 13.86% to R30.40 after its full-year earnings came in below market expectations.
