In a report issued last month business rescue practitioner Herman Bester made the unsurprising yet nevertheless chilling observation that all income or dividends paid to members of Choice Lifestyle Change “were paid from their own money and that the activities of the company were in fact illegal”. In other words, they had been investing in a Ponzi scheme.

Moneyweb has heard suggestions that some individuals invested their entire pension payouts into Choice Lifestyle, and now face an extremely uncertain future. Others allegedly cashed in investments held with banks or other institutions to take advantage of the company’s returns of up to 16% per month. The source of these returns was, however, entirely made up. According to Bester: “No income from any business activities was found.” The bank accounts What Bester has been able to achieve by scrutinising the scheme’s bank accounts is to provide a rare and fascinating insight into the life cycle of a Ponzi scheme. By tracing how much money flowed into and out of accounts held at FNB and Standard Bank, he has been able to show how it is that Choice Lifestyle eventually collapsed. At the start of their lives, schemes such as these generate a lot of excitement by promising, and paying, extremely high returns. In many cases investors are encouraged to reinvest these earnings so that they only appear on paper, and the money is kept within the scheme. These dividends are, however, simply coming out of the investors own funds. During this period, news about the scheme and its returns spreads and this draws in more and more investors. This brings in large amounts of new deposits, allowing those who are running the scheme to pay out earlier investors and also put aside a large share for themselves. Between July 2015 and March 2017, Bester records that Maarten Stapelberg, who ran Choice Lifestyle, paid himself just under R1.5 million from the Standard Bank account. A further R750 000 was withdrawn in cash and more than R1 million was spent on other expenses, including building costs, furniture, flights, hotels, vehicle expenses and clothing. Money from the FNB account was meanwhile transferred to Stapelberg’s personal Absa account, from which over R7 million was paid out to various associates and family members, into other savings accounts, withdrawn in cash, or used for a variety of purchases including property, building materials, and foreign trips. Balancing act For most of this time, the inflow of funds from investors every month exceeded the payments of ‘dividends’. Any excess money was moved into a Standard Bank Capital account. However, inevitably, as the scheme grew it wasn’t attracting enough new members to keep paying out those who were already established. As Bester puts it: “Eventually the payment of dividends started to exceed the inflow of investments”. By August 2017 the FNB account had been closed. Therefore all transactions were taking place through the Standard Bank account. Bester’s analysis reveals that, month by month, the account reflected the following: From August 31 2017 to September 22 2017 Opening balance: R20 780 058 Deposits paid in by investors: R63 857 720 ‘Dividends’ and capital paid out: R64 000 000 Transfer to Standard Bank Capital account: R19 500 000 Bank charges for the month: R72 903 From September 23 2017 to October 22 2017 Deposits paid in by investors: R49 512 779 ‘Dividends’ and capital paid out: R79 316 411 Transfer from Standard Bank Capital account: R19 500 000 Bank charges for the month: R73 887 It was here, as Bester notes, that “the tide had turned”. The amount that needed to be paid out exceeded what was deposited in new investments by nearly R30 million. At this point Choice Lifestyle offered an increased interest rate, which Bester believes was “clearly an attempt to encourage additional investments”. Moneyweb has also previously noted that it was shortly after this that Choice Lifestyle started making excuses about why investors weren’t being paid.

Choice Lifestyle could therefore no longer maintain its façade. Stapelberg was found dead on December 16 2017. No payments have been made to members since.
