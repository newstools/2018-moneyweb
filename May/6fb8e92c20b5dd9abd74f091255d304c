Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said on Tuesday that the outlook for tax revenues remain unchanged, in a blow to the chances of reducing the budget deficit. Nene made the comments in parliament. Treasury Director General Dondo Mogajane said earlier this month that South Africa will struggle to raise the tax revenues needed to reduce a budget deficit and support fragile economic growth due to ongoing problems in tax administration.
