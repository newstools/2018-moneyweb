Alexkor, the state-owned diamond miner, is struggling under the weight of managerial incompetence, non-profitable concessions, the plight of the Richtersveld Community, an accumulated loss of R78.7 million, and is carrying out its operations through middle men who may very well be scraping off the glitter. To compound any speculation as to whether Alexkor has been captured, the rumours of the alleged link to the Guptas and a suitcase of diamonds being smuggled out the country will not go away. The chairperson of Alexkor, Hantse Matseke (aka Hantsi Bhetilda Mayeza), is said to be a long-time ally of Ace Magashule. She is also the chairperson of the Free State Development Corporation). Her husband, Peter “Kop” Matseke, is a business associate of Gupta lieutenant Salim Essa.

Alexkor is an ideal entity to be manipulated by those who are canny and wily.
