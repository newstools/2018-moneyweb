Steinhoff has announced that it is prepared to fight every step of the way against the claims lodged by its previous chairman and one-time largest shareholder, Christo Wiese. In a process update distributed via Sens on Thursday afternoon, the company would, in order to protect the group and its stakeholders, “use all means and resources available to it to vigorously defend the Wiese entities’ action”. The announcement comes exactly two weeks since Wiese lodged two separate claims against the company amounting to R59 billion. The first saw Wiese subscribe for shares in Steinhoff in exchange for vending Pepkor into the company in 2015. The second claim related to the capital injection provided by Wiese to Steinhoff in 2016 to enable it to meet its debt obligations at the time of its acquisition of Mattress Firm in the US.

Steinhoff also stated that it would be presenting its restructuring plan to lenders in a private meeting to be held in London on May 18. “It is imperative that a restructuring plan is agreed with stakeholders as soon as possible in order to provide a more stable trading environment for the group’s operations, its people, suppliers and service providers, and to allow management more time to focus on and assist the underlying business,” the company stated.
