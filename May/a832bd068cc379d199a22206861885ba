The estimate for South Africa‘s 2018 maize harvest is expected to be raised slightly due to favourable weather conditions, with seasonal dry weather allowing for harvesting operations to get underway. The government’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC), which will provide its fourth 2018 production forecast crop on Tuesday, is seen pegging it at 12.9 million tonnes, up 0.6% from the 12.826 million tonnes it forecast in April, according to a Reuters’ poll of four traders and industry watchers. “Harvest should commence in the dry land areas within two weeks or so and conversations with farmers suggest that the yields will possibly vary between average and above average in most areas,” said Wandile Sihlobo, an economist at the Agricultural Business Chamber. Maize prices have remained depressed with the white maize contract currently fetching R2 128 a tonne, about 60% lower than its all time high of R5 350 scaled in January 2016 when a severe drought hit yields and plantings. Low maize prices have helped to ease inflation and food prices but have placed pressure on farmers’ profits. South Africa‘s headline consumer inflation quickened to 4.5% year-on-year in April from 3.8% in March but remains low by historical standards and the rise was mostly driven by a hike in value-added tax.
