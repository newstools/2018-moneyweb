The Ombudsman for Long-Term Insurance (OLTI) has outlined cases in which it considers culture and customary law when resolving disputes between insurers and the insured. In releasing its annual report for 2017, Ombudsman Ron McLaren noted that statistics provide valuable insight into the period under review but that they sometimes tell only half a story. To this end, the OLTI’s office has attempted to show the attention to detail given in resolving complaints particularly when it comes to considering the cultural circumstances and customary law of the insured. In one such case involving a funeral policy, a claim was refused as the insured failed to distinguish between cousin and second cousin. However, the OLTI ruled that the insured ought to be paid out as the term “cousin” includes second cousins in certain South African languages. Another ruling saw an insurer fight a claim related to the death of a 16-year-old, who died of unnatural causes in 2014. The insurer disputed the validity of the deceased’s alleged customary adoption, which the OLTI recognised as legal. Thereafter, the insurer and complainant reached an amicable settlement. Overall, the OLTI’s office received 5 435 chargeable complaints in 2017 compared with 5 284 in 2016. It considered 4 336 complaints during the year and closed 3 371 full cases, and in so doing collected R193.3 million for complainants. At 49.46%, most complaints were about claims denied by insurers. Complaints related to poor service ranked second, with the OLTI compensation of just over R500 000 awarded to 150 complainants for poor service. As expected, the vast majority of complaints were filed against the country’s largest insurance firms.

Old Mutual scored 80.6 points, Discovery Life 76.3 points, Momentum 74.7 points and Liberty 73.9 points. According to Consulta, which polled 2 696 life insurance customers at random, the overall satisfaction score – out of 100 – is based on brands exceeding or falling short of customer expectations and assessing how well a brand is measured against respondents’ perception of the ideal life insurer.
