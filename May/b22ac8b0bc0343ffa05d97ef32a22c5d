South Africa‘s Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) said on Thursday it had suspended all flights of state-run airline SA Express over safety concerns. The decision comes after Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Thursday that he had appointed an “intervention team” to help at the troubled airline, which has lost several executive managers suspended over graft allegations.

In order to be able to operate, SA Express will have to re-apply and be issued with relevant approvals,” it said. Nine of the its 21 aircraft have had their certificates of airworthiness suspended, SACAA said.
