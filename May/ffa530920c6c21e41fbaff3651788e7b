South Africa‘s Nedbank Group said on Thursday it would reappoint Deloitte and scandal-hit KPMG as its joint external auditors for its 2018 financial year, after Barclays Africa Group became the latest company to drop KPMG. Nedbank said it was required to have the same auditor as its parent companies, Old Mutual Plc and Old Mutual Ltd, whose shareholders supported the reappointment of KPMG as their auditor for the 2018 financial year.
