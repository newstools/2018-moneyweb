South Africa recorded a second straight surplus on its trade balance in April as imports of textiles and base metals dipped. The R1.14 billion ($91 million) surplus compares with previous month’s revised R9.3 billion positive balance, the Pretoria based South African Revenue Service said in an emailed statement Thursday. The surplus relieves pressure on Africa’s most industrialised economy’s current account, the broadest gauge of traded goods and services. The rand has strengthened more than 5% since Cyril Ramaphosa took over as leader of the nation’s ruling party in December, boosting investor sentiment and lowering the cost of imports. The median estimate of six economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a R4.7 billion surplus. The positive balance was 4.94 billion a year earlier. South Africa had a record-high shortfall of R27.1 billion in January. Here are some highlights from the statement: Exports fell 9.8% to R88.5 billion compared with a month earlier. Imports decreased 1.6% to R87.4 billion. Exports of vehicles and transport equipment recorded the biggest drop, falling 19% from a month earlier The trade deficit for the year to date is R17.6 billion compared with a surplus of R8.5 billion a year earlier
