South African private hospital group Mediclinic reported a 3% rise in annual core profit on Thursday, boosted by a recovery in its Middle Eastern operations. Mediclinic, which also owns Switzerland’s largest private hospital group Hirslanden, said core earnings – or adjusted earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) – totalled 522 million pounds ($698 million) in the year ended March compared with 509 million pounds a year earlier.
