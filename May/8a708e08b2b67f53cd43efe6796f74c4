South African Reserve Bank (SARB) Governor Lesetja Kganyago on Thursday announced the central bank’s latest decision on its benchmark repo rate. Inflation “The headline inflation forecast is more or less unchanged since the previous meeting of the MPC, despite the upward adjustments to the international oil price and the weaker starting point for the trade weighted exchange rate.” “There is a degree of uncertainty regarding the likely impact of the VAT increase and sugar tax.” “Nominal wage growth trends remain more or less unchanged, and upward pressure on inflation from this source is therefore expected to persist.” “The MPC noted the relative stability of the inflation forecast.” “The MPC assesses the risks to the inflation forecast to have moved to the upside.
