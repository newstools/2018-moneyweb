Capitec is delivering on its diversification strategy with the launch of an insurance unit and novel funeral cover product. The Capitec Funeral Plan, which falls under the banking group’s newest unit Capitec Insure, offers funeral cover from R10 000 to R100 000, with policies starting from R25 per month. According to the bank, it is the most affordable and flexible insurance product of its kind in South Africa. “We designed the funeral plan to be the most affordable, easiest-to-use and straightforward product on the market and based it on the same principles that our business was founded on 17 years ago – simplicity, transparency and affordability,” Capitec chief executive Gerrie Fourie said in a statement. The product is unique in that there are no automatic annual premium increases as long as the cover stays the same. In addition to the policyholder, the plan also covers up to 21 dependents and includes a voluntary pause option, whereby policyholders can pause the policy for up to six months forgoing cover during the period. The funeral plan is underwritten by Centriq, which is a division of the Sanlam Group. Moneyweb was the first to report on a bancassurance joint-venture between the two groups in March – a report confirmed by Capitec in its financial results announcement. Upon the launch of the product, Fourie said that it forms part of Capitec’s diversification strategy to grow its offerings and add more value to clients. In March, Sanlam chief executive Ian Kirk told Moneyweb that the partnership would provide Sanlam with an opportunity to grow its clients in the entry-level market and earn an income off products sold to clients of the bank.
