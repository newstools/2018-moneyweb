Inflation rate increases to 4.5% Headline consumer inflation increased to 4.5% year-on-year in April from 3.8% in March, data from Statistics South Africa showed on Wednesday. Stats SA said the increase was a result of higher taxes on specific products, namely alcohol, fuel and sugary drinks. 5. Where does the workers wage deal sit? The government workers’ wage deal, which was meant to be signed on Monday by unions and government, is stalling as the parties did not settle on an agreement on Tuesday. Bloomberg reported that some unions delayed the signing as they consulted other members, while others rejected the terms. An above-inflation increase has been proposed – at 7% for workers and 6% for already highly paid workers. The Ministry of Public Service and Administration said it is hopeful that the deal will be signed this week.
