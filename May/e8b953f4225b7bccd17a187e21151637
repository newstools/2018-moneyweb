The chairwoman of state-owned logistics utility Transnet has resigned along with two other board members, the public enterprises ministry said on Thursday. The firm has been accused of irregularities in the awarding of contracts and is conducting an investigation into in the procurement of 1 064 diesel and electric locomotives worth around R54 billion. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, whose department also oversees state-owned power utility Eskom, gave no reason for chairwoman Linda Mabaso’s resignation. He added new appointments would be announced soon. Today’s moves are the latest in a string of resignations by Transnet leaders after chief financial officer Garry Pita resigned due to ill-health last month. The government insisted that his departure did not absolve him from responsibility for irregularities at the company that needed to be addressed.
