Warren Buffett said Elon Musk wouldn’t want to come after him in the candy business. Challenge accepted. Musk is “starting a candy company & it’s going to be amazing,” he said in a Twitter post Saturday. He was pushing back after Buffett and his business partner Charlie Munger said the Tesla founder was wrong to believe “moats are lame,” as Musk said in a conference call earlier this week. A moat is a business’s competitive advantage that keeps rivals at bay.

He also tweeted a movie clip from the animated “Trolls,” with characters dancing to Justin Timberlake’s song “Can’t Stop The Feeling!” Musk didn’t provide an explanation for the video. © 2018 Bloomberg
