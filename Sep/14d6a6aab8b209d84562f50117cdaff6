Itâ€™s vital for women of this day and age to focus on building and maintaining their own finances, whether they are married or single. As we go through new experiences, we need to consider certain factors that can affect our independence to being financially free. In this webinar, Emma Nicholls of Liberty discusses what you, as a woman, should do now. Reducing the cost of one cup of coffee a day when young, to deciding on various marriage contracts, and having a retirement policy could save your financial wealth because you have had your children in your later years.
