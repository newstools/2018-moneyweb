Standard Bank Group, Africa’s largest lender, said the Nigerian central bank has confirmed it will not debit more than $2.63 billion from the South African lender over its role in the remittance of foreign exchange on behalf of the local unit of MTN. The central bank will examine new submissions and if justified, review an earlier decision to impose a penalty on the South African lender, Standard Bank said in a statement. Four banks — Standard Chartered Plc, Citigroup, Stanbic IBTC and Diamond Bank — were fined about $16 million between them for their role in Africa’s biggest wireless carrier transferring $8.1 billion out of Nigeria. The Nigerian central bank also said it won’t debit the Johannesburg-based company for the $2.632 billion which it had earlier said Standard Bank “should also be prepared to refund,” it said. Standard Bank, which has said it acted properly in its role as transfer agent, will continue to engage with the Nigerian central bank, it said. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
