Healthcare stocks helped prop up Wall Street on Wednesday, although banks slipped ahead of a widely expected interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. With a third rate hike all but certain, and chances of a fourth increase in December firming after robust consumer confidence data on Tuesday, investors are keen to know whether the Fed will officially end the era of easy money. Financial stocks overall were 0.19% lower, reflecting the drop in bank shares. Only JPMorgan , Citigroup and M&T Bank eked out gains. “If the Fed raises short-term interest rates, that serves to flatten the yield curve and banks want a steeper yield curve,” said Linda Duessel, Senior Equity Strategist at Federated Investors, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “The more the Fed raises the short-term interest rates that makes it expensive to borrow and that chokes off economic growth.” Some analysts are expecting a more aggressive tilt, whether it comes in the policy statement, the accompanying economic and interest rate projections, or at Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference. The stock market has enjoyed a boom period and is at record levels. But as rates rise, equities face rising competition for investors’ funds not only from bonds, but also from cash, which is now the most attractive it has been in about a decade. Utilities and real estate companies, which tend to be favored in a low-rate environment because of solid dividends, fell 0.23% and 0.21%, respectively.
