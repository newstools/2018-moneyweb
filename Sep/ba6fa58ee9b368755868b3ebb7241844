South African retailer Pick n Pay said on Thursday that it expects its half-year diluted headline earnings per share to increase by up to 85% largely due to cost savings from staff layoffs made last year. The company’s shares rose more than 3% after it flagged that its diluted headline earnings per share for the 26 ended August would come in between 95.43 and 100.88 cents per share, compared with a restated 54.53 cents per share in 2017. Headline earnings – South Africa’s most widely watched profit gauge – strip out certain one-off items. Normalised headline earnings per share, which exclude the earnings impact of R200 million ($14 million) spent on once-off severance payments in the prior period, are seen increasing rising up to 20% to 102.69 cents per share. The retailer cut approximately 3 500 jobs or 10% of its workforce in July last year in what it said were cost saving efforts in response to difficult trading conditions. Pick n Pay flagged turnover growth at 6.4% despite constrained consumer spending. Its shares traded 2.92% higher at R69.05 by 11:27 GMT. The company’s half-year results are due on October 16.
