Back in April, JPMorgan Chase & Co gathered a group of clients in Washington for the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and asked for their top choice in the developing world.

Those very currencies led global declines this year, prompting Argentine president Mauricio Macri to turn to the IMF for a $50 billion bailout and Turkey to host a conference call with 6 000 investors to curb the damage. The turmoil sent emerging-market currencies on their longest monthly slide in two decades. Source: Bloomberg JPMorgan declined to comment. Â© 2018 Bloomberg
