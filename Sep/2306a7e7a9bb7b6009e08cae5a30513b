News from the Tax Indaba Tuesday saw the second day of the annual Tax Indaba, and tax practioner, Nishana Gosai, made mention of something which perhaps all South Africans are happy to hear, “higher taxes not the answer to revenue shortfalls’. This comment was made in reference to the deterioration of tax compliance in South Africa. Delegates at the indaba instead resolved that South Africa must increase its tax base and adopt more enabling policies. The indaba takes on its third day on Wednesday. 3.
