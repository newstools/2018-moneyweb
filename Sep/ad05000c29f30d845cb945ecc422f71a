The rand retreated early on Wednesday before the US Federal Reserve’s monetary policy announcement and amid subdued investor appetite for riskier assets. At 0650 GMT the rand was 0.2% weaker at 14.37 per dollar, having closed in New York at 14.34. The rand remains under pressure as it awaits reaction on the US Federal Reserve Bank interest rate decision on Wednesday. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates for the eighth time since late 2015. Investors also remain cautious following second-quarter gross domestic product data on September 4 which showed the economy entered into a recession. A statement by ratings agency Fitch on Tuesday said it was unlikely President Cyril Ramaphosa’s economic multi-billion-dollar turnaround plan would be enough to lift the country’s sluggish economic growth rate. In fixed income, the yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was up 0.5 basis points to 9.155%. Stocks are due open higher at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top 40 Futures index up 0.44%.
