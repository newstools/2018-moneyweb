Barrick Gold agreed to buy Africa-focused rival Randgold in an all-share deal, creating a gold mining company with a combined market value of about $18 billion. Key takeaways In a statement, the companies said the deal would create a gold miner with the greatest concentration of so-called tier assets in the industry. The combined companies would also have the lowest cash cost position among its peers. The strategies of the two companies are similar. Both firms are highly focused on production costs, aiming to build portfolios that generate free cash flow even if gold prices drop to as low as $1 000 an ounce. In Barrick’s case, a merger would help the miner boost output at a time when the stock has been punished for the company’s stagnant pipeline. Both CEOs will continue to play a role in company. John L. Thornton, executive chairman of Barrick, will become executive chairman of the new Barrick Group; Mark Bristow, CEO of Randgold, will become CEO of the new Barrick Group.
