Growth in South African producer prices accelerated at the fastest rate since 2016 in August as fuel prices surged. Producer inflation quickened to 6.3% from a year earlier compared with 6.1% in July, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa said in a statement on its website Thursday. That’s the fastest pace of increases since December 2016. Gasoline prices surged to a record in September even as the government intervened in setting prices for the first time since the early 2000s. Crude has climbed 20% this year and the rand has lost 13% against the dollar, raising the cost of imports of the fuel, which the country doesn’t produce. Petroleum prices climbed 25% from a year earlier, while diesel surged 28% the statistics agency said.
