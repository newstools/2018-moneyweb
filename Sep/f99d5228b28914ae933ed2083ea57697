FNB has become the first major player in the mortgage lending market to forecast negative house price growth, after inflation, over the next three years. In its second quarter Property Barometer, the bank says it forecasts “house price growth to average in a range between 3% and 4% for [the] period to 2020, which would imply a negative rate in real terms [i.e. after inflation] through the … period”.

The bank’s property and household sector strategist John Loos says that should the expected weak growth and rising interest rate environment materialise this year, next and in 2020, “this would be insufficient to significantly alter the housing market’s performance from the current low positive single digit house price growth environment”. The bank points to parent FirstRand’s annual GDP growth forecasts fluctuating “not far from 1.5% for the period up to 2020”, with interest rates also expected to begin “rising mildly” from next year. 12-month averages 2017 2018 2019 2020 Average House Price 4.2% 3.5% 3.7% 3.4% Real House Price -1.1% -1.1% -1.7% -1.8% Housing Demand Strength Index (0-100) 55.5

It argues that this stagnation is “largely the result of the ‘Three Great Stimulus Levers’ having been pulled, leaving little easy stimulus ammunition left”. These levers were: FNB notes that “high household debt, and low interest rates, limit further scope for interest rate stimulus currently, while “growing investor concern around future ability to repay the debt, should it continue to rise, limits further scope” for stimulus. Loos says that “with limited ‘easy’ stimulus ammunition available, South Africa’s myriad of economic structure constraints have become a drag on economic growth. These constraints are numerous, and include underperformance of key state-owned enterprises, notably the main electricity provider, a highly unequal skills distribution, and the well-documented labour market inflexibility, to name but a few”. FNB says that “house prices, on average, have been in decline in real terms (adjusted for CPI) since early-2016”. For the housing market, the bank uses somewhat careful language, calling the current period the “second correction phase”. The first correction was a short and sharp one in 2008/2009, during and following the global financial crisis. In this current “second correction phase”, FNB points to the fact that there has been “little in the way of interest rate stimulus (2 x 25 basis point cuts only)” with GDP growth not “exceeding 1.5% year-on-year at any stage (1.3% average for 2017)”.  With eight months of data available, FNB says it is “highly likely that 2018 as a whole will turn out to be a slower average house price growth year than 2017”. Separately, this will be the fourth successive year of a slowdown in house price growth. In real terms, the average house price decline is at -1% for the year-to-date. FNB says that over the next two/three years, the “housing market would thus remain somewhat off its equilibrium (“equilibrium” referring to where housing demand and supply are in balance), which is seen in the projected average time of homes on the market prior to sale moving in a 16-18 week range, whereas we see around 12 weeks as being more-or-less where market equilibrium is”. Loos says he believes that to “achieve positive house price growth in ‘real’ terms”, economic growth needs “to be nearer to 3%”. He cautions that “a full blown recession (GDP decline) would cause not only ‘real’ house price decline but nominal (actual) house price decline too”. * Hilton Tarrant works at YFM.
