In the online space size and scale count. Thus the acquisition of specialised car buying service WeBuyCars by Naspers’s classifieds business OLX, will make punters pay attention. This is partly because OLX already has an active category listing for used cars; and because Naspers already owns Autotrader.co.za, an online marketplace for new and second-hand cars. But mostly it’s because OLX was prepared to fork out R1.4 billion for the company. The investment forms part of parent company Naspers’s undertaking to accelerate growth in classifieds, online food delivery and fintech businesses globally. “We have invested R7 billion developing our online businesses in South Africa,” Naspers CEO Bob van Dijk said in an online teleconference on Tuesday morning. “Of this, R3.3 billion has been spent in the last year.” WeBuyCars was founded 17 years ago by Faan and Dirk van der Walt and now operates across the country. The deal is premised on the fact that by combining WeBuyCars’s specialised instant buying model with OLX’s online classifieds technology, it will provide a better service to dealerships with improved access to stock, while private buyers and sellers will benefit from additional levels of service and security. “We believe that the technology and services from specialised car buying services like WeBuyCars can help improve the experience of classifieds users across our OLX platforms,” said Martin Scheepbouwer, CEO, of OLX Group in a statement. “We are particularly impressed with the team’s focus on the customer and the lean operating model they have established.” In South Africa Naspers’s other online businesses include Property24, Takealot and MrD Food, for the delivery of fast food.
