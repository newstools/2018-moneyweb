South Africa is expected to harvest 12.9 million tonnes of maize in 2018, the government’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Wednesday, largely in line with market expectations. The CEC’s final forecast was 0.78% lower than a Reuters poll of four analysts which pegged the harvest at 13.002 million tonnes. Its previous three estimates were unchanged at just over 13.2 million tonnes. The 2018 harvest is expected to consist of 6.801 million tonnes of the staple white maize and 6.129 million tonnes of yellow maize used mainly in animal feed, the CEC said in its eighth estimate. The committee attributed the lower estimates to a slower pace of delivery from field to silo. The harvest is expected to be 23% lower than the record 16.82 million tonnes harvested in 2017 after favourable weather conditions boosted yields. Maize prices remain depressed, with the white maize contract ending October fetching R2 330 a ton, about 56% lower than its all-time high of R5 350 scaled in January, 2016, in the midst of an historic drought.
