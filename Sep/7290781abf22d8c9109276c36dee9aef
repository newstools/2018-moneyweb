State capture inquiry The state capture inquiry is still going strong, even as the third week concludes. This week’s matters unfolded in a way we least expected, but it is South Africa after all. The Gupta brothers have asked to cross-examine members who have implicated them in their testimonies, namely, ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and former head of government communications, Themba Maseko, according to Moneyweb. However, Ajay Gupta wants this to be done on his own terms, via video link and from another country, as he fears being arrested if he enters South Africa. Read here and here for more. 5. Rand update The rand went through a lot this week. The GDP numbers released on Tuesday showed a decrease of 0.7%, indicating that South Africa entered a recession. The rand weakened about 2% to more than R15 to the dollar in response. On Thursday, however, news that the current account narrowed to 3.3% of GDP in the second quarter gave the rand a slight boost. On Friday the rand showed signs of recovery as it strengthened 0.75% to R15.22 per dollar at 6:40 GMT. Read: Rand in recovery mode as recession shock eases
