Basil Kassimatis has built up a portfolio of four Roman’s Pizza stores and is a strong advocate for owning multiple outlets as a way to ensure success in food franchising. Critical to the success of any food franchise is site location: it must be visible to passing traffic and easily accessible. In this video, Kassimatis explains how Roman’s Pizza remains true to its founder’s vision of offering the best pizza at the lowest possible price. Brought to you by Nedbank Franchising.
