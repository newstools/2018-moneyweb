Netcare, South Africa’s second-largest private hospital operator, said on Thursday that it expected its full-year Ebitda margins to decline by between 30 and 50 basis points from the previous year, sending its shares to a seven-month low. The prior year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) margin was 21.1%, it said in a statement, citing difficult trading conditions in the second half of the year. Netcare’s shares tumbled as much as 13%, a level last seen in mid-February.
