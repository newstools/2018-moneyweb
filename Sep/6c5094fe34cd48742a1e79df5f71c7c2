Apple fans, prepare to have your wallets emptied. South African Apple retailer, the iStore, has revealed the first official local pricing for the iPhone Xs and Xs Max, which will go on sale on September 28. As expected, they aren’t cheap. The base model, the 64GB iPhone Xs, will retail for R21 999, and the prices only go up from there – all the way to R31 999 for the 512GB Xs Max variant. The iPhone Xr will go on sale later in the year. The prices published by iStore are as follows: iPhone Xs 64GB: R21 999
iPhone Xs 256GB: R24 999
iPhone Xs 512GB: R29 999
iPhone Xs Max 64GB: R23 999
iPhone Xs Max 256GB: R26 999
iPhone Xs Max 512GB: R31 999 Pre-orders of the new phones begin on Friday, September 21, iStore said. The main difference between the Xs and Xs Max models is the screen size, with the smaller Xs sporting a 5.8-inch OLED display (the same as last year’s X), while Xs Max has a giant, 6.5-inch OLED screen. Both models have an improved dual-camera system, A12 Bionic chip with next-generation Neural Engine, faster Face ID, wider stereo sound, longer battery life, and splash and water resistance. In a move that might help offset the pricing somewhat, iStore said it will offer a two-year extended warranty, which includes one Apple-certified screen repair, for free. This extended warranty normally costs R1 999, the company said. Conditions apply and the offer is limited, it added.  — © 2018 NewsCentral Media This article was originally published on TechCentral here.
