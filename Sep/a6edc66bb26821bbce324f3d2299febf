South African media and e-commerce giant Naspers plans to spin-off and separately list its pay-TV unit, it said on Monday. “This marks a significant step for the Naspers Group as it continues its evolution into a global consumer internet company,” the company said in a Sens release. According to the statement, the new company will be named MultiChoice Group and is expected to list on the JSE in the first half of 2019, subject to regulatory approval. Pay-tv is facing stiff competition from the likes of online streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime coming onto the scene. MultiChoice says it is positioning itself for the future with offerings like Showmax and DStv Now. In the last financial year, Naspers’s pay-tv business added 1.5 million subscribers and generated revenue of R47.1 billion. The unbundled entity will include MultiChoice SA Holdings, MultiChoice Africa Holdings B.V., MultiChoice Botswana, MultiChoice Namibia, NMS Insurance Services SA, the African division of Showmax B.V., Irdeto Holdings B.V. and Irdeto South Africa. “Listing MultiChoice Group via an unbundling is expected to unlock value for Naspers shareholders,” Naspers said in the statement. The stake in Tencent is worth around $155 billion, or 40% more than Naspers despite the company owning other assets such as the pay-TV unit MultiChoice, which is a de facto monopoly in Africa. The company says that it will continue to invest in SA through interests in e-commerce businesses such as Takealot, Mr D Food, OLX, Property24 and others. It will also retain interests in Media24. The company’s share price was trading lower following the announcement. Read the full Sens announcement here.
