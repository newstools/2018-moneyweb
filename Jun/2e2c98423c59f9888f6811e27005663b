Telkom has launched a new 150MB FreeMe bundle, offering consumers 150MB of data, 50 SMSes and 150 minutes of on-network calling for R29. Launched as part of the company’s new prepaid campaign, called Z’Kipha More, the new plan is available as an ad hoc purchase only to prepaid, post-paid and top-up clients. It is active for 14 days from date of purchase, after which unused benefits will expire. It includes an additional 150MB of data for messaging and voice calls using WhatsApp, Viber and BlackBerry Messenger. Z’Kipha More also includes Telkom More, which allows customers to double the airtime when they recharge, and SimSonke, which offers out-of-bundle and on-network calls to Telkom fixed and mobile numbers at 30c/minute. Telkom said it has partnered with local rapper and songwriter Kwesta for the launch of the Z’Khipha More prepaid campaign.
