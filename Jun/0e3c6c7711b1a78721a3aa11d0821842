Manny Nichas has been in the franchising business for the last 25 years and understands what it takes to survive in today’s challenging economy. Nichas is part of the Fournews group, which holds seven brands including old favourites such as Moyo and News Cafe as well as popular newcomers like Soul Souvlaki. He says it’s vital to ensure that support structures are in place to accommodate brand growth. “We treasure the franchisee, landbuild supplier and banking relationship. If you have a close-knit family there, you have a successful business.” In this video, Nichas explains the changes being introduced by Fournews at store level and shares advice for individuals coming into the franchise industry in South Africa.
