Builder Aveng rises nearly 30% as takeover regulator approves plans to merge with rival Murray & Roberts Holdings (M&R). M&R is interested in Aveng’s opencast mining business, which would compliment M&R’s underground mining business. M&R plans to buy Aveng for R1 billion ($73.12 million), on the condition that Aveng completes its planned rights offer of at least R300 million. At 11:48, GMT Aveng shares were up 29.4% at 22 cents.
