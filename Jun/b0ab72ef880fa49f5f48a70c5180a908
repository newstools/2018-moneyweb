When it comes to protecting the value of your property and the comfort of your home, regular home maintenance is key. From the moment that you take ownership of your new home and signed off on the confirmation of satisfaction with the developer, home maintenance and repairs become your responsibility and are not the responsibility of the developer, the bond/mortgage provider or the insurer anymore. In the same way that you need to service your car regularly to keep it in good running order, your house needs the same care and attention. All property is subject to what is known as ‘wear and tear’. This is the gradual deterioration of items caused by normal usage, ageing, exposure to weather, insects, and so on. Fixing small maintenance problems at the first sight of deterioration will prevent a small problem from becoming a larger and much costlier one to fix in future. Not only will regular maintenance ensure the comfort and look of your home, but it will mean that you get the maximum value for your property should you decide to sell one day. There is also the insurance aspect to think about. It’s important to remember that insurance is there to protect you against the impact of sudden, unforeseen and accidental events, and not for gradual wear and tear. Claims resulting from a lack of maintenance are likely to be rejected by the insurer. Here are some handy home maintenance tips: Mbuso Mhlanga is the marketing executive at Cosmopolitan Projects.
