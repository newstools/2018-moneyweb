The rand fell against the dollar on Wednesday as the greenback rose broadly after trade-related worries eased amid a slight softening of the US administration’s approach to Chinese investment.

The yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 rose two basis points to 8.9%. The yield had risen to 9.24% last week, its highest since December.
