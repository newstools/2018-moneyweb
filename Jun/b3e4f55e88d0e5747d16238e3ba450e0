Steinhoff International Holdings NV’s Austrian unit is in talks with international insurance companies to find a new credit underwriter for its suppliers. Rudolf Leiner, a furniture chain also known by its brand name Kika/Leiner, expects to conclude the search next week, Chief Executive Officer Gunnar George said in a statement Friday. George said he’s in close contact with suppliers in the meantime. Kika/Leiner sold the Leiner flagship store in Vienna to Rene Benko’s Signa Holding at the end of last year to secure operational funding after Kika/Leiner’s South African parent was rocked by an accounting scandal. The termination of the credit insurance could threaten to cut the furniture chain off from its product supply. Steinhoff, which also owns chains including Conforama in France and Mattress Firm in the US, has plunged more than 97% in value and is in constant talks with creditors about restructuring most of its 9.6 billion euros ($11.3 billion) of debt.
