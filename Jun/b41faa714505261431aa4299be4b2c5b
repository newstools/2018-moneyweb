Gold miner Harmony Gold raised just over R1.05 billion via the issue of new shares, it said on Wednesday, raking in cash to pay down debt used for an acquisition. Harmony took out loans to partly fund the R3.8 billion acquisition of the Moab Khotsong mine earlier this year in a deal that the company said would significantly boost its operational cash flow. The company, which competes with AngloGold , Gold Fields and Sibanye-Stillwater at home, sold 55 million new shares, or 15% stake, at R19.12 each, an 11.7% discount to the closing price on Tuesday. UBS, JP Morgan, Absa and Nedbank arranged the so-called accelerated bookbuild, a share sale done with little to no marketing.
