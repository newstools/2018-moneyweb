Luring former MTN South Africa CEO Mteto Nyati to take over as CEO of Altron from Robbie Venter didn’t come cheap. Nyati was paid a R6.5 million sign-on bonus, the JSE-listed technology group’s annual report, published on Tuesday, shows. In the group’s remuneration report, it said it is “not in the practice” of paying sign-on bonuses. However, Nyati was offered R6.5 million “as part of the restructuring of the group with industry-specialised skills” at executive management level. Nyati joined Altron as CEO on April 1 2017, one month into the group’s 2018 financial year. Two other executives were paid sign-on bonuses, of R1 million and R335 000. “These bonuses were paid in lieu of benefits such as shares and bonuses these individuals were forfeiting by joining Altron. Sign-on bonuses are subject to entering into two-year work-back agreements with Altron,” it said. The annual report shows that Nyati took home total pay of R19.7 million, which was made up of R4.9 million in guaranteed pay, R578 000 in pension payments, R4.8 million in performance-related bonuses, R6.5 million as the sign-on bonus and R2.8 million in share options. Former CEO Venter was paid a total of R5.8 million, most of which was made up of share options (R3.6 million) and guaranteed pay (R1.8 million). Total pay to executive directors was R29.9 million, while non-executive directors earned R10.8 million for their services. The highest paid non-executive director was former Dimension Data CEO Brett Dawson, who earned R2.4 million in terms of a consultancy agreement with Altron. During the 2018 financial year, the overall total cost of employment increase for the Altron group was approved at 4.67% (compared to 4.8% in the 2017 financial year). This did not include wage employees, but only salaried employees. This article was published with permission of TechCentral, the original publication can be viewed here.
