North Korea’s commitment to denuclearisation is a signal that its leader, Kim Jong Un, has finally heeded the message after a meeting with US President Donald Trump, a statement from foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday. Earlier, Trump and Kim pledged to work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and Washington committed to provide security guarantees. Reading a statement from Johnson, Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman told reporters: “We welcome that President Trump and Kim Jong Un have held a constructive summit, this is an important step towards the stability of a region vital to global economic growth.” He added: “There is much work to be done and we hope that Kim continues to negotiate in good faith towards complete verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation.”
