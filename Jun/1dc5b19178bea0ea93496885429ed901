South Africa’s power grid was stable early on Friday but controlled blackouts were still a possibility in the evening if union members don’t return to work, a spokesman for power utility Eskom said. Eskom, which produces more than 90% of South Africa’s power, implemented controlled power outages late on Thursday after hundreds of union members protested over wages. A National Union of Mineworkers spokesman said its members planned to picket outside Eskom power stations from 12 p.m.
