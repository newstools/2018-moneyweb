Bitfinex, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, said hackers may be seeking to prevent users from accessing it via a so-called denial-of-service attack. “The platform is under extreme load,” Bitfinex said in its website Tuesday. “We are investigating. Seems a DDoS attack was launched soon after we relaunched the platform.” The apparent attack is preventing users from accessing the exchange. Bitcoin extended losses after the announcement, dropping as much as 2.2% to $7,360. The exchange suffered multiple DDoS attacks late last year. In August 2016, the exchange said it was hacked for a loss of $68 million. Bitfinex, which doesn’t disclose on its website or in any public documents where it’s located, had been down as it went through “unplanned maintenance” earlier.  Source: Bloomberg
