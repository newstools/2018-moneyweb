The Public Servants Association of South Africa has asked the main sponsor of an annual horse race in the port city of Durban to ensure that none of the horses linked to Markus Jooste, former chief executive officer of Steinhoff International Holdings NV, runs in the event. “Jooste has directly been involved in the Steinhoff scandal that led to public servants losing billions in investments in their pension funds,” the Pretoria-based PSA said in a letter to Vodacom  seen by Bloomberg. “It is our view that Vodacom bears a lot of responsibility as the main sponsors of the race to ensure and compel the organisers that there will be no participation of horses owned by Markus Jooste until investigations are completed.” Jooste quit as CEO of Steinhoff in December after an accounting scandal erupted. The company has since lost 97% of its market value and is being sued by investors and investigated by regulators. The Vodacom Durban July, as the horse-racing event is known, is scheduled to take place on July 7.
