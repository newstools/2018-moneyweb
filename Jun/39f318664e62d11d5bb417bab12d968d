Steinhoff has won more creditor support to give the South African retailer time to restructure debts totalling 9 billion euro ($11 billion) in a fight for survival. The company, which grew rapidly from a small local furniture outfit to a multi-national retailer, said on Tuesday that holders of 93%, 83% and 75.5% of three convertible bonds totalling 2.7 billion euros had agreed to a debt standstill agreement. Steinhoff revealed holes in its accounts six months ago, shocking investors who had backed its reinvention, sending its shares crashing and leaving it scrambling to pay its debts. The creditor support comes nearly a week after Steinhoff won support from creditor group representing 61% of the external debt of two European businesses used to fund its overseas operations.

Shares in Steinhoff were up 1.5% at R1.31, valuing it around R5.5 billion, a reversal in fortunes for the company that was worth R240 billion six months ago.
