We are expecting a pull back to the 12.50 area in the next couple of days. If the pull back in the Euro gets postponed, the rand pull back gets delayed,” Mehut Daya, technical analyst at Nedbank. The benchmark government bond was down by 1.5 basis points to 8.635%. The all share stock index opened 0.6% higher at 58 140 points.
