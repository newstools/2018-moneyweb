South Africa‘s state power utility Eskom has raised its wage increase offer for this year to 6.2% from 4.7% previously, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) said on Thursday. Numsa said in a statement that three unions negotiating with Eskom were demanding a 9% increase in 2018, and 8.6% and 8.5% hikes for 2019 and 2020. Eskom initially said it could not afford any increases, angering unions and triggering protests and a spate of rolling blackouts.
