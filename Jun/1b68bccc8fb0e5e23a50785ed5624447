Glencore and a black-investor group are the only partners in a potential $1 billion deal to buy Chevron’s southern African assets, according to three people familiar with the situation. Business Day, a Johannesburg-based newspaper, reported earlier that South Africa’s Public Investment Corporation (PIC) which invests the pensions of civil servants, could emerge as a 50% partner in a joint bid with Glencore. It didn’t disclose how it got the information. The assets to be acquired include a 100 000 barrel-a-day refinery in Cape Town and more than 800 gas stations in South Africa and neighbouring Botswana. There hasn’t been any indication that the PIC, which handles South African state-worker pensions and is the continent’s largest money manager, would take up any of the stake, said one of the people, who requested anonymity because the information isn’t public. A spokesman for the PIC said no investment decision has been made. Chevron agreed last year to sell its 75% holding in the southern African business to the Chinese group known as Sinopec. However, the deal stalled after black-owned minority partners, backed by Glencore, exercised a preemptive right on the stake. Glencore is supporting black-investor group Off The Shelf Investments Fifty Six as a technical and financial partner, it said previously. Off The Shelf’s investors own the other 25% of the Chevron business.
