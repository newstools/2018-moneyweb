South African energy regulator Nersa on Thursday gave power utility Eskom the go-head to recover R32.69 billion ($2.5 billion) of costs incurred over the past three years through higher tariffs, about half what the utility had requested. Cash-strapped Eskom, which is battling to emerge from governance and financial difficulties, had applied for R66.6 billion to compensate for costs that were not factored in previous tariff increases granted by the regulator. The regulator said it would announce at a later date when Eskom can raise tariffs to recover the costs. Eskom had said it would seek to recover the costs over a period of three years.
