South Africa’s economy contracted in the first quarter and now its business-activity levels are falling behind peers in the region. Purchasing Managers Indexes published on Tuesday showed faster expansion in companies in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda and Zambia in May. In South Africa, however, the index fell to the neutral mark of 50, making it the only country where the PMI didn’t improve. Africa’s most-industrialised economy shrank by an annualised 2.2% in the first quarter, the most in nine years, compared with the median economist estimate of 0.5%. Together with Nigeria, South Africa’s gross domestic product make up about half of the region’s economy. But Standard Bank economist Thanda Sithole said South Africa’s economy is still on track to expand 1.8% this year and 2.2% in 2019. “In our view the PMI will, during the remainder of 2018, largely show signs of improving domestic conditions,” she said in a note. “The ongoing debate on land expropriation, elevated international oil prices and a volatile rand, remain key risks to our PMI outlook.” Source: Bloomberg © 2018 Bloomberg
