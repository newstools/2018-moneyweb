South Africa‘s rand steadied on Thursday after sliding to a new seven-month low against the dollar on Thursday, with investors betting recent volatility could provide some short-term profit opportunities. At 14:30 GMT, the rand traded at 13.8500 per dollar, 0.07% firmer. The currency slipped to a session low of 14.00 in early trade before quickly recovering. “The corrective bounce is gaining momentum. Focus is turning to the 13.7850 high of 21 June, where already overstretched intraday studies could promote consolidation,” said analysts at Continuum Economics. The rand, like its emerging market peers, has been hurt by fears of a global trade war. Locally, a stalemate in wage talks between power utility Eskom and labour unions has added to bearish sentiment. South Africa‘s power utility Eskom on Thursday raised its wage increase offer to 6.2% from 4.7% previously. US President Donald Trump’s hardline approach to trade relations is curbing demand for emerging assets and stoking volatility.
