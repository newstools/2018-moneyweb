Following weeks of speculation, Steinhoff has sold its furniture retailer Kika/Leiner  to Austria’s largest privately owned real estate company Signa Holdings. The deal includes Kika/Leiner’s operating assets as well as the properties it trades from. The business, which operates a network of 73 shops, with 23 of those in central and eastern Europe, was acquired in June 2013. By 2018 it was in dire straits and last week its credit insurers withdrew their cover for the company. The business needs further funding besides a turnaround plan focusing on reducing product range and headcount, according to Reuters. The deal, once it becomes unconditional, will see Signa paying a nominal amount for the operating businesses, and fair value for the properties. Once the deal is done Steinhoff will be freed from any cash demands from Kika/Leiner.
