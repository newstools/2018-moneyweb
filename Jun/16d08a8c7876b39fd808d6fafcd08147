Capitec has agreed to an out of court settlement with Summit Financial Partners, more than two years after the consumer-focused group sued the bank. Summit, in 2016, brought a case against bank alleging that its multi loan product was in contravention of South Africa’s credit laws and accused Capitec of being a payday lender. The bank denied the allegations. The product in question was discontinued in February 2016 and Capitec, today, announced that all summit assisted and initiated court cases against it had been withdrawn. It did not disclose the terms of the settlement. Capitec and Summit have agreed to work together to improve the unsecured lending industry. “This initiative will include programs to improve consumer financial literacy, providing effective consumer debt relief solutions and building consumer financial capability. We believe that this is an important joint step in  bringing positive change in the South African credit industry,” Capitec said in a statement.
