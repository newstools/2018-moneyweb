The London Stock Exchange Group Plc said it will resume trading shortly, after its opening auction was delayed in a rare outage for the stock market. It’s set to commence trading at 9 a.m. UK time. A spokeswoman for the exchange on Thursday couldn’t immediately provide more information. The group operates one of Europe’s largest cash equity markets. The bourse’s main cash equity market and Alternative Investment Market are among those affected. The exchange in recent months also experienced issues with its regulatory news announcements. LSE has been without a permanent chief executive officer since Xavier Rolet departed in November. New chief, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive David Schwimmer is due to start in August. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
