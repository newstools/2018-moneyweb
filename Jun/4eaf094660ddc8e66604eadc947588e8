The SABC has appointed Madoda Mxakwe and Yolande van Biljon as its new group CEO and chief financial officer respectively, the public broadcaster’s board said on Sunday. Van Biljon starts the job on Monday, June 25, while Mxakwe takes over as CEO on July 1. The two will bring greater stability of the state-owned company, the board said. Mxakwe, who has held senior executive positions in business, communications and public affairs in both the private and public sector in South Africa and abroad, has the “required business acumen, experience and decisive leadership skills in business turnarounds and transformation”, the board said. He has an MA (global political economy) from the UK’s Sussex University as well as executive leadership development certificates from the London Business School. He also has a PGD in business administration from the Gordon Institute of Business Science. He has worked for Nestle in senior capacities, most recently as country head responsible for Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho. Van Biljon, meanwhile, has worked for the likes of Denel Dynamics (as chief financial officer) and Glad Africa Group. She has a BCom (accounting), BCompt (hons), BComm (hons) and MComm (tax). She qualified as a chartered accountant in 1996. “These appointments affirm our commitment to attract and retain the best skills to take the SABC to greater heights, particularly to address the evolving broadcasting environment enabled by technology and the changing media consumer patterns. We are proud to say that these appointments reflect diversity in relation to skills, age, gender and race,” said SABC board chair Bongumusa Makhathini in the statement. “The board believes that these two appointments will strengthen the organisation’s position as a credible and reliable public service content provider.”  — © 2018 NewsCentral Media This article was originally published on TechCentral here.
