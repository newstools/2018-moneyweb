The retail price of petrol in South Africa will rise by 5.5% from June 6, while the price of wholesale diesel will rise by 6.4%, the energy department said on Friday. The price of petrol will rise by 82 cents to R15.79 per litre in the commercial hub of Gauteng province, while diesel will go up by 85 cents to R14.19 per litre. The Central Energy Fund said the weaker rand exchange rate versus the dollar was the main reason why fuel prices would rise sharply. The rand has fallen more than 1% since the beginning of May.
