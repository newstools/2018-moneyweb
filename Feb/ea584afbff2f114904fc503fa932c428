Here’s what caught our attention on Monday Monday sees the start of the four-day Mining Indaba held in Cape Town, where mining specialists and investors meet to discuss the challenges being faced by South Africa’s mining industry. The issue of miners’ health and safety is a topic that anticipates scrutiny, especially after miners were trapped last week in Sibanye-Stillwater’s Beatrix mineshaft. The indaba will be convened by Minister of Mineral Resources, Mosebenzi Zwane.  The energy department has announced that the retail price of petrol and the wholesale price of diesel is set to drop on Wednesday, as a result of the rand strengthening. The price of petrol will fall by 30 cents to R14.12 per litre in Gauteng; diesel will go down by 17 cents to R12.56.  The ruling party’s top officials and the highest decision-making body, the National Working Committee, are planning to meet with President Jacob Zuma on Monday, Bloomberg reported. The pressure against the president to step down is mounting and officials are aiming to have him removed before the State of the Nation address on Thursday.  On Friday, the public enterprises ministry said that the government has approved an application by Eskom to buy more renewable power from independent producers. After years of financial uncertainty the deal comes as a new and positive investment into the economy, Reuters reported.  S&P Global Ratings said the outlook for South African banks are stable for the first time since 2013. The outlook is attributed to local banks’ robust financial performance and because banks were able to find their balance between weak economic growth and low investor and household confidence, according to Business Report. S&P published its report on Friday.
