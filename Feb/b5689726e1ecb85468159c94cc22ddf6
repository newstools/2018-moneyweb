South Africa’s rand pulled back from three-year highs scaled earlier in Monday’s session as technical factors weighed, while stocks rose with Sasol among the advancers after it posted solid results. At 15:00 GMT, the rand was 0.58% weaker on the day at 11.61 to the dollar, after earlier hitting 11.51, its best level since February 2015. But momentum indicators tracked by some analysts suggest the rand is near over-bought levels, which could cap further gains even against the globally softer dollar, as investors bet the new head of the US Federal Reserve will steer a steady course. The rand’s rise to three-year highs has been driven in part by the resignation earlier this month of scandal-tinged former president Jacob Zuma and his replacement by Cyril Ramaphosa, who is seen as investor friendly and committed to good governance.
