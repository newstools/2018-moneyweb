If the 10-year US Treasury yield hits 4.5% by year-end, the economy would probably muddle through — stocks, not so much, according to Goldman Sachs Group. Goldman’s base-case scenario calls for a 10-year yield of 3.25% by the end of 2018, though a “stress test” out to 4.5% indicates such a move would cause stocks to tumble, economist Daan Struyven wrote in a note Saturday. He also said the economy would probably suffer a sharp slowdown but not a recession. “A rise in rates to 4.5% by year-end would cause a 20% to 25% decline in equity prices,” the note said.  While a recent drop in stocks may have been fuelled by concerns tied to the 10-year yield approaching 3%, many strategists have said they felt equities could continue to rise until reaching 3.5% or 4%. A 20% to 25% drop in stocks, as measured from the S&P 500’s Jan. 26 peak close of 2,872.87, would take the gauge to a range of approximately 2,155-2,298. It closed on Friday at 2,747.30 after dropping as low as 2,581 on Feb. 8 at the apex of the recent volatility-fuelled meltdown. If this scenario did play out with Goldman’s numbers, stocks would have a long way further down to go. © 2018 Bloomberg
