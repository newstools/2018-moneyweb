Optimum Coal mine, linked to the politically connected Gupta family, will be suspended if managers fail to comply with the site’s social and labour plan, the Department of Mineral Resources said. The DMR conducted an inspection on February 8, it said in an email. Optimum Coal must take measures to reach compliance within 60 days of an order — in the process of being issued — or face a suspension, the department said. Gupta-controlled Oakbay Investments and Duduzane Zuma, the former president’s son, bought Optimum through Tegeta Exploration & Resources for R2.15 billion from Glencore Plc in December 2015. Oakbay didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Oakbay said in August that it agreed to sell Tegeta for R2.97 to Swiss company Charles King SA. The sale, which includes the Optimum and Koornfontein mines and a stake in Africa’s biggest coal-export terminal, was expected to be concluded in 12 months, Oakbay said at the time. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
