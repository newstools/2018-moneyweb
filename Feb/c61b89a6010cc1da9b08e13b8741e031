South Africa’s government bonds rallied, sending the yield below 8% for the first time in three years, and the rand gained as the budget convinced most investors the country is doing enough to stave off another debt downgrade. With Moody’s Investors Service poised to lower the country’s local-currency credit rating to junk, investors were looking for evidence the government is willing and able to curb debt and trim the budget deficit under the leadership of newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa. They got that: debt is projected to stabilise sooner and at a lower level than previously forecast, while the fiscal shortfall is seen narrowing over the next three years, the National Treasury said in its budget review. “The market is rallying, bonds are outperforming at the moment,” said Gordon Kerr, a fixed-income analyst at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg. “The market feels that the budget will be good enough to stave off a downgrade by Moody’s.”  The currency climbed 0.7% to 11.64 per dollar by 2:29 pm in Johannesburg. Yields on benchmark government notes due December 2026 fell 11 basis points to 7.99%, the lowest on a closing basis since May 2015. The rand has advanced 12% since Ramaphosa was elected as leader of the ruling African National Congress in December, setting him on a path to become the country’s president when Jacob Zuma resigned last week. Growing investor confidence has resulted in currency strength and lower borrowing costs, which together with spending curbs enabled the government to target a lower fiscal shortfall, Treasury said on Wednesday.
