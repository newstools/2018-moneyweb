The Dow is now down 8.5% from its record and the S&P 500 is down 7.8% since then. “It looks to me like a typical type of scenario when you see a single stock flash crash where you’ll see bids just disappear, stop orders get kicked,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. “The overall market could have taken a cue from some of the bigger names.” The CBoe Volatility index closed at its highest since August 2015.
