South Africa’s rand opened weaker on Tuesday, with investors pocketing profits after the currency briefly rallied to a three-year high overnight as new president Cyril Ramaphosa changed his finance minister in a broad cabinet reshuffle. At 0630 GMT the rand was 0.19% softer at 11.56 per dollar, backing off the 11.51 level touched late on Monday, its firmest since February 2015. The rand attracted immediate buying interest as Ramaphosa said he had appointed Nhlanhla Nene as finance minister, two years after Nene’s sacking from the same role triggered the revolt within the ruling party that eventually ousted Jacob Zuma. “Markets largely anticipated the reshuffle and a big portion of strength has been priced in,” said an analyst at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, Bianca Botes. Technical indicators showed the unit was straying into overbought territory, and that the effect of local politics would give way to international factors. “More and more I believe the global dollar story will take a hold and the rand will be susceptible to those events in the future, (and) the correlation between SA and the rest of EM will start to increase again,” said chief trader at Standard Bank, Warrick Butler. Bonds were weaker, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 up 2.5 basis points at 8.035%. Stocks opened firmer at 0700 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 index up 0.36% at 52 049 points.
