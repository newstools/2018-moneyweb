US stock index futures pointed to a strong start for Wall Street on Monday, with investors hoping that new Fed chair Jerome Powell will keep the US central bank on a steady course of monetary tightening. Powell faces questions from both houses of the US Congress in a semi-annual testimony starting on Tuesday, his first major set piece since he took over from Janet Yellen earlier this month. His testimony comes at a time when investors have been anxious about the pace of interest rate hikes, which have weighed on equity markets globally. “There’s some talk of him (Powell) being a little more open to tolerating inflation running above the 2% target. The focus will be to see if he is indeed open to that and the rationale behind it,” said Aaron Clark, portfolio manager at GW&K Investment Management. The Fed said on Friday it expected economic growth to remain steady and saw no serious risks on the horizon that might pause its planned pace of rate hikes. The week is heavy on data, with a report on personal consumption expenditure, the Fed’s favourite gauge of inflation, expected on Thursday. By 8:34 am ET, Dow e-minis had gained 143 points, S&P 500 e-minis added 10 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis rose 27 points.
