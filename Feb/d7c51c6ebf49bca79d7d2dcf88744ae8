South African President Cyril Ramaphosa decided the nation’s budget will be presented on Feb. 21 as planned, Ismail Momoniat, the head of tax and financial sector policy at the National Treasury, said. While the Treasury considered postponing the event when Jacob Zuma was still president, Ramaphosa “is determined” it should go ahead on time, Momoniat said in an interview in Johannesburg on Thursday. Ramaphosa was sworn in as president on Thursday after Zuma resigned late Wednesday amid pressure from the ruling African National Congress, which he headed until December. Ramaphosa will on Friday deliver the state of the nation address after the event was postponed last week when Zuma was still the leader of the country. © 2018 Bloomberg
