South Africa’s Competition Tribunal on Tuesday dismissed a complaint brought by Massmart accusing grocery retailers of anti-competitive behaviour, saying the unit of Wal-Mart had failed to present a strong case. The decision is a blow for Massmart’s ambitions to expand further into the grocery market, which is dominated by industry giants such discounter Shoprite and upmarket retailer Woolworths. Massmart is in the middle of transforming its flagship Game chain from a primarily electronics retailer to one that sells groceries. It lodged the complaint in 2014, saying its expansion into the fresh grocery sector was being hampered by lease arrangements that restrict malls from renting out space to rival food retailers. The tribunal upheld, for the second time, arguments made by retailers Shoprite Checkers, Pick n Pay and Spar Group and found that Massmart had failed to make a strong case of anti-competitive conduct. “The other problem for Massmart is that its business case has driven its competition case and not vice versa,” the tribunal said in a statement. Massmart was not immediately available for comment.
