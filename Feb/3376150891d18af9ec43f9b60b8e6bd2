South Africa will likely harvest 27% less maize in 2018 compared with the record crop last season on the back of a dry spell in the western part of the maize belt, the government’s Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Tuesday. The CEC, which gave its first production forecast for the 2017/2018 season, estimated production at 12.22 million tonnes compared with the 16.82 million tonnes harvested in 2017 after favourable weather conditions boosted yields. The 2017 harvest was the largest on record, surpassing the previous record of 14.656 million tonnes set in 1981. The 2018 harvest is expected to consist of 6.11 million tonnes of the food staple white maize and 6.11 million tonnes of yellow maize used mainly in animal feed, the CEC said. A spell of hot, dry weather over a swathe of the maize belt earlier in the year raised concerns about plantings and yields. The estimate was 8% higher than a Reuters’ poll of six analysts and traders, which pegged the harvest at 11.301 million tonnes. White maize prices have however remained depressed after a bumper 2016/2017 crop across the region with the contract ending May down 65% to R1 884 from highs of R5 376 reached in January 2016 when yields were hit by a severe drought.
