South Africans awoke to a nation without Jacob Zuma as president for the first time in nine years on Thursday, after the scandal-plagued head of state reluctantly resigned on orders from the ANC. Acting president Cyril Ramaphosa is due to be confirmed as Zuma’s permanent successor in a parliamentary vote at 2pm, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said. The road back to prosperity and self-respect under Ramaphosa, who became ANC head in December, will be long and hard in a nation divided by race and inequality. But Zuma’s departure offers evidence of the strength of South Africa’s institutions, from the courts to the media and the constitution. He resigned as president late on Wednesday after nine years in office.

State of the Nation Address Ramaphosa is due to be chosen by lawmakers as permanent president later in the day, a role he will fill until elections next year. His appointment appears certain as the ANC holds a majority in parliament, though lawmakers will hold a secret ballot if he is not the sole candidate. “The office of the chief justice has made itself available today to officiate in the business of electing a new president,” Mthembu told a parliamentary committee meeting. The speaker of South Africa’s Parliament, Baleka Mbete, has received a letter from Jacob Zuma informing her of his resignation as president, Mbete’s office said in a statement on Thursday. Mbete’s office also said that the finance minister was scheduled to deliver a budget speech at 14:00 local time on February 21, as planned. Ramaphosa’s first state of the nation address was expected to take place on Friday. The speech had been scheduled to be delivered by Zuma last Thursday, but was postponed after pressure mounted for him to resign. The rand currency, which has gained ground whenever Zuma hit political turbulence, soared to a near three-year high against the dollar on Zuma’s resignation.

Police said on Wednesday three people were arrested during the raids on various properties in Johannesburg. State broadcaster SABC said a Gupta family member was among those detained, while a senior judicial source said police were expected to arrest up to seven more people and that Gupta family members would be among them. Police said the raid was in connection with a state-funded dairy farm, which prosecutors last month called a “scheme designed to defraud and steal”. The suspects were expected to appear in court on Thursday.
