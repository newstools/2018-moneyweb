Cell C plans to more than double spending on its network this year as South Africa’s third-largest mobile-phone company embarks on an acquisition spree that’s already taken in local fiber providers IConnect and Greencom. Capital expenditure will increase to R3 billion ($256 million) from R1.2 billion in 2017, when the carrier put expansion on hold while completing a protracted recapitalisation, chief executive officer Jose Dos Santos said at a results presentation in Johannesburg on Tuesday. Cell C’s now in the process of making “several” acquisitions in the fiber market and is also looking for deals in financial services, he said. The recapitalization by fellow Johannesburg operator Blue Label Telecoms helped Cell C reduce its debt by more than 70%, enabling it to better compete with larger rivals Vodacom Group and MTN Group. That deal, which saw Blue Label take a 45% stake, took almost two years to complete due to regulatory scrutiny and threats of legal action by a minority shareholder. “The recapitalization deal afforded us a R15 billion turnaround,” from having a negative value under the debt burden, Dos Santos said. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation soared by 151% in 2017 to R7.8 billion, while sales rose 7%. © 2018 Bloomberg
