Water expert Prof Anthony Turton is of the opinion that Cape Town’s Day Zero won’t be averted as the city fails to stop water being released from its system into the sea. Turton, who is from the University of the Free State Centre for Environmental Management, joined Fred Platt, CEO of JSE-listed Accentuate, in a call to action to address the water crisis in Cape Town and beyond. They addressed a media briefing hosted by the National Press Club in Pretoria on Wednesday. Moneyweb on February 2 reported that Platt called on Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa to constitute a war room to address the water crisis. Platt said on Wednesday that Ramaphosa’s office subsequently contacted him in response to the report and he expects further engagement. Turton on Wednesday warned that Gauteng’s water security is also at risk due to delays in the second phase of the Lesotho Highland water scheme.
