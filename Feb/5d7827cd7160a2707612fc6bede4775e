Swooning markets Thursday cost the world’s 500 richest people $93 billion in net worth, and 20 of them lost at least $1 billion each. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, saw his fortune drop by $5.3 billion to $113.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, as his Amazon.com tumbled 4.7% on the day. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett’s wealth dropped $3.5 billion and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg lost $3.4 billion.  Elon Musk came back to Earth, dropping $1.1 billion in net worth after his Space Exploration Technologies successfully launched a Tesla sports car on a journey around the sun. Shares of Tesla, which he also leads, plunged 8.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index both tumbled to their lowest levels since November as fears of rising interest rates and inflation intensified. © 2018 Bloomberg
