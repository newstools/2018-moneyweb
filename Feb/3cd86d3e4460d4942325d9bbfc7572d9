South Africa’s rand traded flat early on Wednesday after losing ground against the dollar overnight as comments by the new chairman of the Federal Reserve reignited bets of higher interest rates in the United States. At 0650 GMT the rand was 0.02% firmer at 11.7225 per dollar compared to an overnight close of 11.7250 overnight in New York. The rand hit a session-low of 11.77 following new Fed chair Jerome Powell’s upbeat views on the economy, which stoked bets on further interest rate hikes this year and lifted the greenback to near a three-week high. South African lawmakers on Tuesday voted in favour a motion seeking to change the constitution to allow land expropriation without compensation, a move that could spook investors according to some analysts.
