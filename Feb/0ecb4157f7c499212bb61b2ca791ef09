US stock markets bounced after a torrid opening on Tuesday, bargain-hunters and gains for Apple pushing the tech-heavy Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average into positive territory after two days of heavy losses. Both the S&P 500 and the Dow sank more than 4% on Monday, their biggest falls since August 2011, as concerns over rising US interest rates and government bond yields hit record-high valuations of stocks. New York’s three main indexes sank as much as 2% on the opening bell but they quickly moved back into positive territory. An almost 2% gain for Apple was at the heart of an almost half% gain for the Nasdaq Composite. “Daily drops of 3% or more have been buying opportunities for the S&P 500 post financial crisis,” said Lori Calvasina, head of US equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. At 9:49 a.m. ET (1449 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.25% to 24 406.14. The S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 2 654.25 and the Nasdaq 0.4% to 6 993.47.
