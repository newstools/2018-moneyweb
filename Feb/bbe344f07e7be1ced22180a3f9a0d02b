South Africa’s Imperial Holdings reported record half-year revenue and a 16% jump in earnings on Tuesday, buoyed by acquisitions, increased vehicle sales and a strong performance from its Imperial Logistics unit. Imperial, which is also involved in transportation, warehousing and distribution management, has undergone an aggressive disposal and acquisition programme since 2014. As of last June it had disposed of 42 businesses and 52 properties while investing billions of rand to acquire more than 15 companies. Imperial, which also has operations in Europe, reported basic headline earnings per share (heps) for the half-year to December 31 of 717 cents, up from 618 cents a year earlier. Heps is the most widely watched profit gauge in South Africa and strips out certain one-off items. Operating profit rose 5% to R3.1 billion ($264 million) on group revenue up 11% to a record R66.5 billion. “Imperial produced solid results and an improvement in all key financial metrics …supported by acquisitions, increased vehicle sales in Motus and a good performance from Imperial Logistics, particularly in South Africa,” the company said in a statement. Imperial Logistics’ operating profit rose to R1.3 billion, while Motus, its motor vehicle business, recorded a 5% rise in operating profit to R1.7 billion. It announced an interim dividend of 323 cents per share, up from 320 cents a year earlier. ($1 = R11.73)
