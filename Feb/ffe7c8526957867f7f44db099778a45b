A committee of top officials from the African National Congress, South Africa’s ruling party, is due to meet on Monday after its six most-senior leaders met with President Jacob Zuma, who is facing mounting pressure to step down. “The NWC will meet tomorrow,” ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule said by phone, referring to the national working committee that’s one of the highest decision-making structures. “Everything is under control. There’s no crisis.” The country’s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, was elected as ANC leader in December, defeating Zuma’s preferred candidate, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. While Zuma’s second and final term is only due to end next year, his immersion in a succession of scandals has eroded support for the ANC and many with the party’s ranks want him to go before he delivers the annual state-of-the-nation address on Feb. 8. An “urgent notice” sent to members of the NWC, a 26-member group that oversees the day-to-day operations of the party, scheduled the meeting for 2 p.m. in Johannesburg. © 2018 Bloomberg
