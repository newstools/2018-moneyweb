South African President Jacob Zuma summoned cabinet ministers to a meeting in Cape Town on Tuesday, eNCA television reported, as pressure builds on the embattled 75-year-old leader to quit. Zuma normally holds cabinet meetings on Wednesdays. It was not immediately clear why Zuma had summoned the meeting a day ahead of schedule. South Africaâ€™s ruling African National Congress has called a special meeting of its decision-making executive for Wednesday, at which analysts have said the party could call for Zuma to resign.
