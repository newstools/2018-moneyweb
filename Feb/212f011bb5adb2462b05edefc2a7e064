Wall Street was set to open higher on Wednesday after data showed US economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought in the fourth quarter, weakening the case for faster rises in interest rates. The US Commerce Department said gross domestic product expanded at a 2.5% annual rate, instead of the previously reported 2.6% pace. Strong economic data earlier in the month had raised fear among traders that US interest rates would rise faster than previously expected, sparking Wall Street’s biggest selloff in two years. Even with the gains the S&P 500 and the Dow are still on course for their first monthly fall since last March. “As February comes to a close, large gyrations experienced during the month could very well spill into next month as topic of rates dominates,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York, wrote in a note. Among early decliners was No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe’s, whose shares slumped 7% after its quarterly profit missed estimates as margins fell. Celgene also fell about 7% after US health regulators rejected the company’s application seeking approval of a key multiple sclerosis drug. World stocks were also set to snap a record 15-month winning streak due to data signaling a slowdown in China’s manufacturing and Japan’s industrial output. At 8:41 am ET, Dow e-minis rose 49 points, S&P 500 e-minis were up 4.25 points and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 24 points. A Reuters analysis showed global investors cut their equity exposure to a three-month low in February, though most still expect stocks to test new highs despite rising bond yields. The US 10-year Treasury yields, the benchmark for global borrowing costs, was last at 2.8953% after spiking as much as 2.9250% on Tuesday. Wall Street’s main volatility gauge, the CBOE Volatility index eased to 17.91 points after hitting as much as 18.98 during Powell’s testimony.
