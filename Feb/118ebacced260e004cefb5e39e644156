South Africa’s second largest crude oil refinery, the 135 000 barrel per day Engen plant in Durban along the east coast, will close for routine maintenance from February 5 to March 30, the company said on Monday. “The planned outage will primarily focus on essential plant maintenance and inspection activities as well as process regeneration activities,” Jehan Zaib, general manager at the plant, said in a statement. The refiner is majority-owned by Malaysian state oil firm Petronas.
