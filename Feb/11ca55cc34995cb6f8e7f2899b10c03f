South Africaâ€™s maize output last year was more than double the previous harvest and the largest crop on record after favourable weather conditions boosted yields, the Crop Estimates Committee (CEC) said on Thursday. The CEC said the 2017 harvest totalled 16.82 million tonnes maize, up 116% from the 7.779 million tonnes harvested in the previous year. The crop, which surpassed the previous record of 14.656 million tonnes set in 1981, comprised 9.916 million tonnes of food staple white maize and 6.904 million tonnes of yellow maize.
