Here’s what caught our attention on Friday  National Treasury has called for an international investigation into Viceroy Research, after it published a report on Capitec Bank’s loaning processes. The bank responded by dismissing all of Viceroy’s claims, which boosted its share price. On Thursday, Treasury said the Financial Services Board should alert regulators on whether Viceroy is appropriately regulated. Capitec’s stock gained the most in two years on Thursday, concluding four days of losses following the Viceroy report.  This weekend, President Jacob Zuma will be meeting the ANC top six. The party is trying to reclaim its name and improve its conduct. Party members have previously held discussions on removing Zuma as president. Reuters has reported that this weekend’s meeting adds to speculation that he might be removed as president.

Multichoice made headlines after making payments to Gupta-owned company ANN7 to ‘influence government policy’ and for negotiating with the SABC.
