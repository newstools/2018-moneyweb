South Africa’s ruling African National Congress will hold a two-day meeting of its top body starting Sunday, according to three members of the committee. The meeting of the National Executive Committee will be held against the backdrop of growing speculation that newly elected President Cyril Ramaphosa is planning cabinet changes and several provincial leadership disputes in the party. The committee members who confirmed the meeting asked not to be identified because the matter hasn’t been made public. The ANC’s spokesman, Pule Mabe, and media manager, Khusela Diko, didn’t respond to calls or messages seeking comment. © 2018 Bloomberg
