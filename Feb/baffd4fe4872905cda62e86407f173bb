South African deputy finance minister Sfiso Buthelezi said on Tuesday that Wednesday’s budget will be presented by finance minister Malusi Gigaba, as speculation swirled about whether Gigaba would keep his job. “The question that is being asked of the minister, if he is going to present the budget. That is why we are here. There is a budget that is going to be presented tomorrow and it is going to be presented by nobody else but Malusi Gigaba,” Buthelezi told reporters at a media briefing. New President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to reshuffle his cabinet and Gigaba, seen as loyal to Zuma, is among ministers likely to be affected.
