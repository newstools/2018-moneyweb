Here’s what caught our attention on Monday: ANC top officials will be meeting in Pretoria on Monday to finalise plans to remove President Jacob Zuma from the presidency and begin a new national administration. Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, speaking at a Nelson Mandela commemoration in Cape Town on Sunday, said he will give the country the closure it needs. A #ZumaMustGo picket is also taking place at the Union Buildings. Public Protector Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane was summoned by the Justice and Correctional Services Committee on Sunday, after “concerning comments” she made to the public on the Vrede Dairy Farm project. A press release issued by Parliament stated that it needed clarity on these comments and that it’s also concerned about her office allegedly suppressing evidence. Taste Holdings CEO Carlo Gonzaga tendered a notice of his resignation as CEO, effective immediately. Gonzaga will be with the group for six months to support the board and  his successor Tyrone Moodley. Moodley had been a non-executive director since October 2016. The board said it welcomes the change. Former Steinhoff chairman Christo Wiese cut his stake in the retailer to 6.2%. Bloomberg reported that this move may mean that one of the country’s richest men is no longer the biggest shareholder in the company. The retailer came under fire after accounting irregularities surfaced late last year. The Resilient stable of companies is being accused of having high premiums to net asset values that could not be justified. The accusations come from a report by Dubai-based Arqaam Capital on Friday evening. The report was leaked without the knowledge of the company. Moneyweb reported that Resilient has acknowledged the report.
