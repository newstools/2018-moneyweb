Bitcoin edged lower rather than break above $10 000, triggering a selloff in other large digital coins. The largest cryptocurrency was up 3.1% to $9 573 as of 11:43 am in London, after halting a march higher when it came within 0.3% of the resistance level. Ripple erased its increase, while Ethereum and Litecoin retreated from advances of as much as 15%.  Bitcoin is holding onto gains for a seventh time in eight weekday sessions, a feat it hasn’t achieved since early December. Optimism for cryptocurrencies this week coincides with a rebound in global stock markets. Digital coins appear to be taking in stride the latest reports of hacking and suspected fraud at firms holding the assets. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
