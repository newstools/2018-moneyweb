Capitec’s boss has bought R1.5 million ($126 300) of shares in the South African lender, exchange filings showed on Thursday, as he seeks to shore up confidence in the firm after a research report this week sparked a selling frenzy in the stock. US firm Viceroy Research criticised Capitec’s lending practices and said it understated defaults, triggering a brief slump of 25%  in its shares. Capitec dismissed the report as “flawed with inaccurate statements,” while the South African Reserve Bank vouched for the liquidity and solvency of the country’s No.5 bank by value. Chief executive Gerrie Fourie spent R1.5 million on shares in the company on Wednesday, exchange filings showed, a move hailed by one trader as a vote of confidence in Capitec. “It’s a good way of showing that the directors are prepared to take the risk, so why wouldn’t the shareholder,” said Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods. Capitec shares rose more than 4% to R828.12 in early trade, outpacing a flat blue-chip JSE Top-40 index. The stock was also boosted by news late on Wednesday from rating agency S&P Global, which said the Viceroy report and subsequent market reaction would not affect its BB/B with a stable outlook rating, which falls within the speculative range. “To date, the bank has experienced only mild funding outflows and its liquidity remains sound,” Capitec said in a statement on Thursday, quoting the ratings firm’s bulletin.
