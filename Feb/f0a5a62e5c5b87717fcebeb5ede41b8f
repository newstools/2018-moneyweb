Water levels at dams supplying South Africaâ€™s Cape Town fell further this week, data showed on Wednesday, the latest sign of a deepening crisis that could soon see taps in the tourist hub run dry by May. Dam levels in the Western Cape province fell to 23.7% this week from 24.5% the previous week, and from 36.5% a year ago, according to a weekly update from the department of water affairs.
