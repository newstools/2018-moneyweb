The speaker of South Africa’s parliament, Baleka Mbete, said on Tuesday that the president’s state of the nation address, which had been scheduled for Thursday, would be postponed, piling added pressure on embattled President Jacob Zuma. Zuma has faced growing pressure to step down as head of state since he was replaced as leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) in December. Earlier Mbete had said a request by opposition parties to postpone the president’s state of the nation address was being considered. Opposition parties wanted the speech postponed until after a no-confidence vote on Zuma’s leadership. The speaker of parliament had scheduled the no-confidence vote for February 22.
