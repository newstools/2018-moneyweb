President Jacob Zuma broke his silence for the first time on Wednesday since discussions about his exit began. In an interview with state broadcaster the SABC, Zuma said an order by the ANC that he step down as head of state was “unfair” as the party had not spelled out what he had down wrong. The President of the country says we are spending more time discussing “Zuma must go” than on policy issues and “I don’t understand why”. Zuma says he agreed with Ramaphosa and ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule last week on a delayed resignation but that the ANC’s top six rejected the plan of a staggered resignation. He says he is open to further discussions but that the ANC is rushing. The manner in which it is being implemented, “I have a problem with”. “I think we are being plunged into a crisis that my comrades my regret.” Zuma says nobody has taken him through the disciplinary processes of the party. He said he would issue a statement later on Wednesday.
