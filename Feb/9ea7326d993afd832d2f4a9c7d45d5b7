South Africa’s chief prosecutor has received a recommendation from his office’s investigators on whether to pursue corruption charges against former President Jacob Zuma. National Director of Public Prosecutions Shaun Abrahams “will advise in due course on the way forward,” spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku said by phone on Friday. The country’s appeals court in October upheld a lower court ruling that a decision to drop charges against Zuma in 2009, weeks before he became president, for allegations relating to an arms deal was “irrational,” opening the way for the case to proceed. Zuma had argued to the National Prosecuting Authority why the charged should be scrapped. © 2018 Bloomberg
