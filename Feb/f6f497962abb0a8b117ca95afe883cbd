Bitcoin climbed for a fourth day, accelerating a rally that began when it bounced off a technical support level. The biggest cryptocurrency rose 8.9% to $10 985 as of 12:08 pm in London. That brought its increase to 54% since February 6, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. Bitcoin outperformed its closest rivals — Ripple, Ethereum and Litecoin — which gained about 2%.  Until regulators gain a better grip on them, digital currencies will struggle for wider acceptance in mainstream finance, according to S&P Global Ratings in a report published on Monday. “The future success of cryptocurrencies will largely depend on the coordinated approach of global regulators and policymakers to regulate and enhance market participants’ confidence in these instruments,” the ratings firm said in the report. Among the banks S&P rates, “exposure to cryptocurrencies appears to remain limited.” Bitcoin last closed above $11 000 on January 29. © 2018 Bloomberg
