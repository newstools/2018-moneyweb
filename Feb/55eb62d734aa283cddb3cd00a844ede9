South Africa’s rand opened weaker in local trade on Wednesday following volatile overnight trade caused by uncertainty over President Jacob Zuma’s future. At 0645 GMT the rand was 0.4% softer at 11.96 per dollar, having rallied as far as 11.89 as trading in New York approached close before Asia trade knocked it back toward the 12.00 mark. News that the ruling African National Congress (ANC) had postponed Zuma’s state of the nation address scheduled for Thursday spurred bets his resignation was imminent, but the cancellation of a party meeting where his future would be discussed dimmed hopes of an early exit.
