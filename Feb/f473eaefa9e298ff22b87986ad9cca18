Read: Defiant Zuma dares ANC to fire him At 1522 GMT, the rand ZAR=D3 was up 0.44% from its New York close on Friday to 12.03 per dollar. The rand lifted as the ruling African National Congress (ANC) met on Monday to discuss Zuma’s future amid growing pressure on the 75-year-old leader to step down as head of state over corruption allegations and a weakened economy. The rand has tended to strengthen on signs that Zuma could step down before his second term as president ends next year. Zuma has been in a weakened position since he was replaced as leader of the ANC in December by Cyril Ramaphosa, the deputy president. “The political roulette continues. The market will continue to honour the fact that Ramaphosa has begun taking important decisions in the background,” Commerzbank analysts said in a research note.
