eMedia Investments – the parent company of eTV and 24-hour television news channel eNCA – has blasted MultiChoice for the comments made by its CEO Calvo Mawela on Wednesday over the annual payments made by the company for its five television channels. WATCH: MultiChoice clears itself of wrongdoing MultiChoice has defended its relationship with the former Gupta family-owned ANN7, saying it found no evidence of corruption and wrongdoing regarding the hefty pre-payment and annual broadcasting payments made to the news channel. MultiChoice is still feeling the heat from allegations of bribery and corruption, relating to it entering into commercial agreements with ANN7 and the SABC to influence government policy on the encryption of digital terrestrial signals and set-top boxes. MultiChoice allegedly paid ANN7 R141 million per annum and a once-off amount of R25 million to air the channel on its digital platform, while the SABC was paid R100 million per annum to host its 24-hour news channel. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Mawela defended the payments saying that they are not “unusual and abnormal” as these payments have also been made to channels owned by eMedia. Mawela said eNCA was paid “R500 million annually”, which is “less than the payments made to the SABC and ANN7”. Although he didn’t confirm the total amount paid to ANN7, he said it is “above R100 million”. “We were paying [eNCA] far much more than the other two channels but nobody questions what influence we were buying there. It baffles me sometimes that just because we were negotiating with SABC and ANN7, people are linking it back to encryption,” he told reporters. eMedia has taken Mawela to task over his comments, saying he revealed “confidential contractual information” about its broadcasting agreement with MultiChoice. eMedia is contracted to provide five channels to DStv on a non-exclusive basis – the same basis as ANN7 provides its news channel to MultiChoice. The channels that are included on an exclusive basis are eNCA as well as Afrikaans news bulletins for kykNET. DStv is owned by MultiChoice. Vasili Vass, eMedia’s group head of corporate affairs, said in a statement that the total amount currently received from MultiChoice for all of the services is “significantly below the amount suggested by both the MultiChoice statement” and Mawela’s comments. This is despite eMedia’s services being more extensive than the ANN7 offering and its services attracting larger audiences on the DStv platform. “The overstatement of the amount payable, to justify amounts paid in respect of ANN7, is distressing,” said Vass. Supporting the views of eMedia is its recent financial results. In its interim results to end September 2017, eMedia said its profits fell by nearly R100 million partly due to DStv renegotiating its license fee agreement and that of its five other channels. eNCA’s license fee was cut by DStv to R140.8 million from R267 million. “The suggestion made by Mr Mawela that questions have not been asked of the MultiChoice agreement with eNCA is misplaced,” said Vass. “The amount paid pursuant to an ordinary commercial contract such as eMedia’s is irrelevant when it comes to the issues facing MultiChoice and their relationship with ANN7. That relationship, which has been ventilated in the media and the court of public opinion, details serious allegations of bribery, corruption and impropriety.” An internal probe by the MultiChoice board revealed that the firm and its executives didn’t engage in corrupt practices. However, MultiChoice admitted to making “mistakes” in its due diligence process into ANN7. Read: MultiChoice says it made mistakes, but denies corrupt conduct In a move to turn public opinion in its favour, MultiChoice took the drastic decision not to renew its broadcasting contract with ANN7 when it expires in August 2017. In other words, ANN7 will be booted off the DStv bouquet. Mawela said MultiChoice failed to do a due diligence on ANN7 given the “controversies around the television station and state capture in the country”. He also said MultiChoice was poor in the management of its contract negotiations and lobbying efforts with the television channel. “We could have communicated better and we should have acted better on concerns over ANN7.”
