Shares in South African telecoms giant MTN rose 8% on Thursday in its first trading session since it agreed to pay $53 million to settle a row with Nigeria’s central bank that had threatened to cost it billions. The Central Bank of Nigeria – MTN’s biggest and most lucrative market, but also its most troublesome – had been demanding $8.1 billion from Africa‘s biggest telecoms company, which it said the firm had illegally repatriated.

But after the firm provided additional documentation, the bank concluded that only one 2008 private placement was irregular. “MTN Nigeria will pay the notional reversal amount ($52.6 million) without admission of liability,” MTN said in a statement on Monday. The central bank’s initial order threatened to wipe out more than half of MTN’s market capitalisation at the time it was issued in August, and spooked investors just as the company was trying to reassure them of its frontier market-focused strategy after a series of costly legal problems. While the telecoms heavyweight still has to fight a $2 billion tax bill from Nigeria’s attorney general, the settlement, agreed on Monday, marks a turning point for MTN after four months of uncertainty that dragged its share price down more than 20 percent to its lowest since 2009. The company’s shares were up 7% at R91.49 by 0751 GMT.
