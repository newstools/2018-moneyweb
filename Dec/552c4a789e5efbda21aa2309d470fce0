The rand is reasserting itself as the wild child of emerging markets. The currency’s price swings have been the widest among 24 of its peers in the past week as risk assets have been rocked by everything from concern over the US-China trade dispute to Britain’s Brexit confusion. In that time, the rand has shed 3.5 percent against the dollar. The rand is also climbing back up the implied volatility ladder. After being overtaken by Turkey’s lira in May, the rand’s one-week implied volatility against the dollar is now a hair’s breadth away from regaining the top spot. Its expected price swings briefly surpassed the lira’s on November 28 before dropping back again. The rand climbed to a three-year high against the dollar in February before giving up its gains to slump 13% this year as domestic political turmoil, liquidity and debt problems at state-owned companies, and stagnant economic growth added to global headwinds. After falling 1.6% on Monday, it gained 0.5% today to 14.31 per dollar by 3:15 pm in Johannesburg as reports showed mining and manufacturing output beat estimates in October.  Price swings will probably widen as trading volumes dry up toward year-end, according to Michelle Wohlberg, a fixed-income trader at FirsRand Bank in Johannesburg. “December liquidity is officially here and with it comes the joys of a volatile market,” she said in a note to clients.
