South Africa’s business confidence rose for a third consecutive month in November, boosted by higher export and import volumes and manufacturing output, a survey showed on Thursday. The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (Sacci) monthly business confidence index rose to 96.1 in November from 95.8 in October, the business body said in a statement.
