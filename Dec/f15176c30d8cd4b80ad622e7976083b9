Updated fee structures from three of the country’s five largest banks – Absa, Nedbank and Standard Bank – show inflationary increases for 2019 in the middle and upper-middle market segments, but close to double-digit increases at the lower end. At the higher end, monthly account fees are up in line with inflation, while in the far more competitive and price-sensitive middle market, increases are more moderate. Bundled pricing for entry-level account bundles is up sharply, at 9% for Nedbank’s Ke Yona Bundle (to R58) and 10% for Absa’s Flexi Value Bundle (to R65). In July, FNB hiked the price of its Easy Smart Option (bundle) by 9% (to R65). Standard Bank does not offer a comparable account. For basic entry-level accounts, only Nedbank has kept pricing frozen (at R5.50 a month). Absa’s Transact and Standard Bank’s Access accounts are up 7% year-on-year, to R5.30 and R5.60, respectively. In July, FNB increased its Easy account pricing by 10% to R5.75. All increases for Absa, Nedbank and Standard Bank are measured year-on-year from January 1, but it must be noted that all three adjusted fees on April 1 to account for the increase in value-added tax (Vat) to 15%. This means the change from the fees customers are currently paying (which includes the Vat adjustment) will be slightly lower than the year-on-year one. 2018 2017* Change ‘Platinum’ accounts Absa Premium Banking (Includes seven withdrawals and five cash deposits at Absa ATMs) R179 R169 6% Nedbank Savvy Bundle

For example, Standard Bank Elite Banking increased from R195 to R196.71 Per-transaction pricing, as well as those which are “out-of-bundle” are mostly higher, with anything involving cash increasing significantly. Branch transactions, especially those involving cash, are excluded from the below comparison but have priced these to ruinous levels to discourage customers from using this (expensive to operate) channel.  2018 2017* Cash withdrawal – Own bank ATM Absa R6.50 (Transact), rest R4.50 + R1.50 per R100 R6 (Transact), rest R4.50 + R1.40 per R100 Nedbank R7 (Pay-as-you-use), rest R2 per R100 R6.50 (Pay-as-you-use), rest excl. Savvy Bundle R4 + R1.50 per R100 Standard Bank R1.85 per R100 R1.80 per R100 Cash withdrawal – Other ATM Absa R10.50 + R1.50 per R100 R12 (Transact), rest R10.50 + R1.40 per R100 Nedbank R8 + R2 per R100 R12.50 + R1.50 per R100 Standard Bank R9 + R1.85 per R100 R8 + R1.80 per 100 Prepaid purchase (own digital channels) Absa R1.50 R1.50 Nedbank R1 (Pay-as-you-use), rest unlimited R1 (Pay-as-you-use), rest unlimited Standard Bank R1.20 R1.10 Card replacement fee Absa R140 R140 Nedbank R135 R130 Standard Bank R135 R130 * The three banks passed adjustments to account for the increase in Vat from April 1, 2018. For example, Standard Bank Elite Banking increased from R195 to R196.71 ATM cash withdrawal fees are largely up below inflation, except the flat-rated fees on Absa’s Transact and Nedbank’s Pay-as-you-use entry-level accounts. It is difficult to calculate the increases because of the fee structure – a flat-rate, plus an amount per R100 withdrawn – but a sample of costs for a R1 000 withdrawal are included below. At around the R19 level, this equates to a 2% fee for a R1 000 withdrawal. Lower amounts will attract a larger relative fee because of the structure.  2018 2017 Change R1 000 withdrawal – Own ATM, excluding bundled transactions Absa Transact R6.50 R6 8% Nedbank Pay-as-you-use R7 R6.50 7% Absa (other accounts) R19.50 R18.50 5% FNB* R19 R18.50 3% Nedbank (excluding Savvy Bundle) R20 R19 5% Standard Bank (excluding bundled transactions) R18.50 R18 3%     R1 000 withdrawal – Other bank’s ATM Absa R25.50 R24.50 4% FNB* R28 R26.50 5% Nedbank R28 R27.50 2% Standard Bank R27.50 R26 5% * FNB’s pricing runs from July 1 to June 30 each year. While pricing is broadly in line across the three banks that will change their prices on January 1, there is a noticeable difference in their card replacement fees (R135/R140), versus FNB’s which it dropped to a flat R100 across all accounts in July. * Hilton Tarrant works at YFM.
