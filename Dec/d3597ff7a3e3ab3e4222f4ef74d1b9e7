Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari presented an 8.8 trillion-naira ($24.2 billion) budget for next year to lawmakers after the cabinet agreed to reduce spending plans as the nation struggles to meet revenue targets. Nigeria, Africa’s biggest oil producer and most populous nation, has “recovered from recession” after a slump in 2016, Buhari told a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives in the capital, Abuja, broadcast live on TV. President, cabinet members reviewed and approved next year’s spending plan on December 7. Nigeria’s budget has more than doubled since 2015 to 9.1 trillion naira this year and the spending cuts come as the country prepares to hold presidential vote in February.
