The ruling African National Congress postponed its conference on finalising lists for elections next year to give provinces time to conclude the process, the party said. The conference would be rescheduled to January 4-5 from this weekend to accommodate the North West province, which hadn’t submitted its nominations, ANC acting spokesman Dakota Legeote said by phone. The conference had been delayed because of deep divisions within the party and allegations by some members of manipulation of the lists, City Press reported on Sunday. South Africa is due to hold national and provincial elections in 2019, likely in May. The country has a proportional representation system in which lawmakers are chosen according to where they sit on nomination lists. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
