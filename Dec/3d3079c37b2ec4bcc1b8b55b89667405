The price of gasoline in South Africa’s economic hub of Gauteng will fall to the lowest since March next month. A litre of 95-octane gasoline will decrease R1.23 to R14.01 in Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and the capital, Pretoria, the Central Energy Fund said in an emailed statement Friday. Diesel will decline R1.53 a litre to R13.13 in the province. Fuel prices in South Africa, which imports oil, surged to a record in October as the rand depreciated and international crude prices rose. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
