The mayor of the Vhembe district, Florence Radzilani, has handed in her resignation over the VBS scandal. According to the Mail and Guardian, she allegedly received R300 000, although Radzilani says she is leaving office with a clear conscience after being vindicated by two forensic investigations. Alongside Radzilani, six other mayors were told to go for being implicated in the VBS saga. If convicted, the mayors may face criminal charges and jail time.
