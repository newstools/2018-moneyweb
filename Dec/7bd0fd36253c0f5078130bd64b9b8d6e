President Cyril Ramaphosa named Shamila Batohi South Africa‘s new chief prosecutor on Tuesday, after the Constitutional Court ruled in August that the appointment of the previous prosecutor was invalid. The highest court in the country ruled that Ramaphosa’s predecessor, Jacob Zuma, had abused his powers by removing chief prosecutor Mxolisi Nxasana and appointing Shaun Abrahams as his replacement in 2015.
