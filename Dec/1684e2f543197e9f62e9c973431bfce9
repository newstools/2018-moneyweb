Delta, part owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev, will buy Diageo’s South African sorghum beer-brewer, United National Breweries. The purchase, the terms of which weren’t given, will be Delta’s first acquisition in South Africa and its second outside Zimbabwe. Delta bought Zambia’s National Breweries, also a brewer of sorghum beer, in January. Sorghum beer is a lower cost product than the lagers, or clear beer, that dominate the southern African market. Delta’s sorghum beer product sells under the brand Chibuku and comes in containers of as much a 1.5 liters, or almost three pints, known as a scud after the missiles used by Iraq during the first gulf war. Delta spokeswoman Patricia Murambinda wasn’t immediately available for comment, her office said when contacted Friday.
