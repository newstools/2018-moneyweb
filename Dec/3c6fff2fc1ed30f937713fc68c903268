Here’s one way to get investors back into the battered marijuana sector  throw $1.8 billion into it. Cannabis stocks climbed Friday morning after Altria Group, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes for the US market, agreed to buy a minority stake in Cronos Group, the fourth-largest Canadian cannabis producer by market valuation. The gains bring some relief to cannabis investors, who, as of Thursday’s close, had been poised for their worst weekly loss in six weeks after a short-seller report targeted Aphria, raising questions about broader governance and financial disclosure in the adolescent industry.

The stocks have been trending downwards over the past two months as the initial exuberance that propelled valuations to record levels ahead of Canada’s move to legalize recreational adult use cooled abruptly as the reality of supply constraints and high prices set in. A pair of exchange-traded funds tracking the marijuana sector in the U.S and Canada have lost at least 30% since October 15, two days before the regulation change. Cronos added as much as 38% at 9:38 a.m. Friday in Toronto, its biggest intraday gain since July 2016. Aurora Cannabis Inc. rose as much as 11%, Canopy Growth climbed 7.3%, and Tilray gained 4.8%. Aphria gained as much as 14%, retracing some of its losses this week, although the stock is still poised to end the week at its lowest price since November 2017.
