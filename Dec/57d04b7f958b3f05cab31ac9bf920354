US financial markets will close Wednesday for a national day of mourning to honour former President George HW Bush. The New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq’s US equities and options markets, CME Group’s US-based equity and interest-rates markets and CBOE Global Markets’s exchanges will shut, the companies said. They will also observe a moment of silence on Monday. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association has also recommended that fixed-income cash markets close on Wednesday, according to a statement. US financial markets traditionally close following a presidential death. The most recent observation was January 2, 2007, after the death of President Gerald Ford. “The President will designate Wednesday, December 5th as a National Day of Mourning. He and the First Lady will attend the funeral at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC,” White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
