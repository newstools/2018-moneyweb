Music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA saw its market value jump $779 million as China’s Tencent Music Entertainment Group kicked off its long-awaited US initial public offering. Spotify owns 8.9% of the company, whose largest shareholder is Tencent with 59%, according to its IPO filing Monday. Spotify closed up 3.2% to $140.68 a share on the same day, giving it a market value of $25.5 billion.  Monday’s boost helped lift Spotify further out of its November slump, when shares fell below their $132 reference price set before it went public in April. China’s largest music-streaming service and investors are offering 82 million American depositary shares at $13 to $15 each, which would raise as much as $1.23 billion, Monday’s filing shows. The top end of the range implies a market value of $24.5 billion. The deal is expected to price December 11 after market close, according to terms for the deal obtained by Bloomberg. Tencent Music’s net income for the first nine months of the year more than tripled to $394 million as revenue nearly doubled to about $2 billion, the filing shows. Stockholm-based Spotify acquired a minority stake in Tencent Music last December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
