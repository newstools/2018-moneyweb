Warren Buffett’s role in the saga of Home Capital Group , the embattled Canadian alternative lender, is coming to a close, with Berkshire Hathaway  saying it will “substantially exit” its investment in the company. More than a year after taking a stake in Home Capital to shore up confidence after a near collapse, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway will hold less than 10% of the company when the lender completes a repurchase of shares on Friday, according to a statement Wednesday. Buffett swooped in last year to take a stake in the company and provide it with a C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) credit line, which replaced an existing emergency credit facility.
