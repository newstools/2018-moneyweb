The Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) now has R1.8 trillion assets under management, up 8.3% (R1.7 trillion) from 2017. There are 1 273 125 active members, and 450 322 pensioners and beneficiaries. Cash and cash equivalents amount to a healthy R22.2 billion (2017: R30.2 billion). Included in cash and cash equivalents are short-term investments of R19.5 billion (2017: R27.7 billion). These investments comprise money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The GEPF provides no details of these money market instruments. Eskom was provided with a bridging loan of R5 billion from February to March 2018, which was repaid with interest. It is possible that this bridging loan was provided from the short-term investments account. Funding levels The funding levels provide an indication of the health of the fund. The minimum funding level is above the target of 100%, but the long-term funding level is following a downward trajectory. An actuarial valuation is carried out every three years, and the last one is dated March 31, 2016. The actuarial valuations to date show a declining long-term funding level, from 83.1% as at March 31, 2014 to 79.3% as at March 31, 2016. This falls below the board of trustees’ target of 100%. Even though the 2016 actuarial valuation indicates that the GEPF is 115.8% funded, the long-term funding level indicates that only 79.3% of the liabilities and the recommended reserves could be afforded at that date. Actuarial valuations Minimum funding level (%) Long-term funding level  (%) March 31, 2014 121.5 83.1 March 31, 2016 115.8 79.3 December 31, 2018 ? ? The actuarial valuation is based on the assumption that the fair value of the assets is correct. The board of trustees is responsible for the valuations of the unlisted investments, which “involves the use of various complex valuation models and sensitive inputs as well as significant board of trustees’ judgements”. The external auditors, Deloitte and Nexia SAB&T, opined: “We consider the disclosure of the unlisted investments in the financial statements to be relevant and appropriate.” We will have to wait for the next actuarial valuation to be completed at the end of December 2018. But much has transpired since 2016. The JSE All Share Index has dropped from 55 474 (March 30, 2018) to 51 038 (December 7, 2018). As this will have a negative impact on the fair value of assets in December, it is expected that the 79.3% level should drop. However, I am not sure if the actuarial valuation will rely on the fair value of assets as at March 31, 2018 or December 31, 2018. Investments Investments include listed equities, domestic bills and bonds, unlisted equities, and foreign collective investments. Not all investments are registered in the name of the GEPF: The net investment income of R153 billion for 2018 (2017: R72.1 billion) indicates an excellent return of 8.5% on the investments of R1.8 trillion. Or does it? A reality check is the cash statement. Cash is king. Cash income, comprising interest and dividends received for the year, amounted to R75.1 billion (2017: R74.4 billion). However, net contributions and benefits paid for the year resulted in a deficit of R18.7 billion (2017: R18.4 billion). An amount of R56.5 billion (2017: R26.7 billion) was spent on purchasing new investments. The other adjustments to investments comprise the few minor cash items, and then the large journal entries, namely, impairments for the year of R7.4 billion (2017: R1 billion), and the massive adjustment to fair value of R69 billion (2017: R60.9 billion). The impairments comprise mainly the Lancaster Group (R4.3 billion) and Independent News and Media (R1 billion). Fair value of assets The fair value calculation is subjective, and it has been checked by the external auditors. Nevertheless, it has a significant impact on the investment return as well as the actuarial funding level. Between the GEPF and the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) (asset manager for the GEPF), detailed schedules have now been provided of all listed and unlisted equity investments, all direct loans, advisory fees, transaction costs per service provider, trading costs per investment, and the quantum of capital allocated to bond issuers. A total of R183.1 billion has been allocated to state-owned enterprises (R95.5 billion to Eskom). Listed equity investments can be evaluated according to information in the public domain. However, it is not possible to do so for unlisted equity investments or loans. The GEPF includes loans under unlisted investments. However, the GEPF does not provide the interest rate payable on loans, nor does it provide details of any unpaid interest or unpaid dividends. Accounts receivable includes investment debtors of R2.2 billion (2017: R2.7 billion). Presumably this reflects unpaid interest and unpaid dividends on the unlisted investments? The detailed Isibaya Investment Schedule as at March 31, 2017 provided to parliament by the PIC, which includes loans and equity investments on behalf of the GEPF, provides an indication of unpaid interest and nil equity returns on investments. Many direct loans were not paying over any interest. This raises three questions: 1. Is unpaid interest capitalised, and added to the loan? In other words, would this be included in the ‘increase’ in the investment? 2. Is the impairment of investments in the amount of R7.4 billion for 2018 realistic? 3. If no interest has ever been paid on a loan, is it realistic to expect the capital payments to be made? Significant future events It is trite that the government pension fund is guaranteed by the government. Any guarantee becomes useless if the guarantor starts running out of funds. The sad reality is that until all the audited reports of the various state-owned enterprises dribble in, no one has any idea how dire the situation is. The GEPF funds are the last remaining deep well surrounded by encroaching desert – until that too runs dry. Unfortunately, taxpayers will take the eventual hit.
