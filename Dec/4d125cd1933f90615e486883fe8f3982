Netflix is working to release its first-ever South African — and African — original television series, it was reported on Monday. According to Independent Group’s IOL Entertainment website, the global streaming giant will collaborate with the stars of South African film Catching Feelings, Pearl Thusi and Kagiso Lediga, for its first-ever African original series. The new show, called Queen Sono, involves Thusi taking on the role of a highly trained South African spy. Lediga will direct the show, which will be produced by Tamsin Andersson. The announcement comes after Netflix said last month that it will soon offer more local programming to its audiences on the continent. Variety reported last week that Netflix had confirmed plans to commission original series from Africa in 2019. The entertainment website quoted Erik Barmack, Netflix’s vice president of international originals, as saying that its European team was “in the process of looking at opportunities in Africa. It’s definitely the case that we’ll commission some series there in … 2019.” IOL reported that Queen Sono, which will launch in 190 countries next year, will be the first of many productions Netflix plans to do in Africa. The development comes as rival Showmax, owned by MultiChoice, plans to release its second locally made series. The Girl From St Agnes is a murder mystery and Showmax’s second original show after the well-received Tali’s Wedding Diary.
