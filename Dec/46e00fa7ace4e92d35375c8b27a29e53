Dubai’s school market is turning in favour of parents, according to Knight Frank. “The education sector in Dubai is now at a tipping point, with aggressive marketing and tuition fee discounts symptomatic of an oversupply of schools,” according to a report. Education providers are facing further pressure with the addition of 13 schools in the current academic year, bringing the total number of private schools to 207. The increase in supply comes even after Dubai imposed a freeze on school-fee hikes. GEMS Education, the Dubai-based school operator backed by Blackstone Group, postponed plans for an initial public offering after the decision, people with knowledge of the matter said in June. The United Arab Emirates, which Dubai is part of, has taken a number of measures to curb a rise in the cost of living and stimulate a sluggish economy. A 2017 study by HSBC Holdings found spending on children’s education in the UAE is the second-highest in the world, after Hong Kong. The increased supply may particularly affect mispriced schools — expensive schools in mid-income neighbourhoods that already have below average occupancy rates, Knight Frank said.
