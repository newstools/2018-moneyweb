McDonald’s announced a new beef antibiotic policy affecting 85% of its global supply chain intended to reduce the use of antibiotics important to human health. Because of the chain’s massive buying power, the plan has the potential to change practices for the overall beef industry. As consumers have grown increasingly concerned with how their food is made, they have demanded a number of changes, including antibiotic-free meat and poultry. Scientists say the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture is behind the growing global problem of antimicrobial resistance.  The announcement includes three benchmarks: measuring current antibiotics usage in its top 10 beef sourcing countries, setting reduction targets for medically important antibiotics by the end of 2020, and requiring that suppliers report progress in meeting those targets starting in 2022.
