G4S is weighing an exit from a $1.5 billion cash-transportation business that’s been hit by waning use of cash in developed markets and a wave of attacks on armoured trucks in South Africa. A review of the division is expected to be completed next year, London-based G4S said in a statement on Thursday. The unit, which accounted for about 16% of group revenue in 2017, could be valued at about 1.57 billion pounds ($2 billion), according to RBC Capital. Shares of G4S jumped the most in more than two years on an intraday basis. The move comes after a reorganisation of G4S at the start of this year, which divided the group into two arms focused on private security services and cash handling. Profitability in Cash Solutions has been on the wane as retailers in developed countries shift to digital payments, and partly due to surge in the number of attacks on its vans in South Africa, which has increased costs. The company aims is to establish two strong, independent businesses, G4S Chief Executive Officer Ashley Almanza said in the statement, without saying whether the cash arm will be sold or spun off. Competitors include Prosegur Cia. de Seguridad, Loomis, and Brink’s Co. “The board believes that a separation of Cash Solutions has the clear potential to enhance the focus and success of both businesses and thus to unlock substantial shareholder value,” the company said in the release. The business, which operates across 40 countries with services including topping up cash machines, has been investing in new technology to expand revenue streams. Shares of the company surged 8.9% to 199.70 pence as of 8:18 am in London, lifting the group’s market value to 3.1 billion pounds.
