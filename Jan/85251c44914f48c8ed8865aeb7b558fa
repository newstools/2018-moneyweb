Apple Inc plans to release a software update for the iPhone in the spring that will let users view their health records, get new animated emojis on the iPhone X and disable a feature that slowed down iPhones in order to preserve battery life. A long-anticipated addition to the iPhone’s Health app, the health records feature will enable users to pull up their medical history, such as past procedures and lab results. Apple has partnered with 12 hospitals on the feature, including Johns Hopkins Medicine and UC San Diego Health, the company said in a statement Wednesday. The iOS 11.3 update also improves the company’s ARKit augmented reality platform for iOS devices and will let users project virtual objects onto walls and doors. Apple is working on a multiperson mode for ARKit that would improve gaming apps, expected later this year, Bloomberg News has reported. Once the update arrives, users will be able to measure the health of the battery and turn off an unpopular function that slows down iPhones to preserve battery longevity. The software update will also improve security for HomeKit devices, music video playback in the Apple Music service, add a new video section to Apple News and send location information to emergency services during a call. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
