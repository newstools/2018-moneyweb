South Africa’s lawmakers will have a draft procedure relating to the removal of a sitting president of the country ready in two weeks’ time.  Parliament’s subcommittee on the review of the National Assembly rules plans to have the final document by mid-February, and will send this to the rules committee for adoption then, the Cape Town-based institution said in an emailed statement Wednesday.  On December 29, the country’s top court found that parliament had failed to hold President Jacob Zuma to account for his role in a scandal involving the misuse of public funds on his private home and ordered it to draft rules governing the circumstances under which he could be removed from office.
