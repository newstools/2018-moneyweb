Water levels at dams supplying Cape Town fell further this week, data showed on Tuesday, the latest sign of a deepening crisis that could soon see taps in the tourist hub run dry by April. Dam levels in the Western Cape province fell to 24.5% this week from 25.3% the previous week, and from nearly 38% a year ago, according to a weekly update from the department of water affairs.
