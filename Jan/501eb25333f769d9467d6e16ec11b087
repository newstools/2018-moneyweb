Steinhoff has largely contained its operational liquidity crisis, it said on Friday, as the troubled South African multinational retail group tallied the damaged stemming from an accounting scandal. Steinhoff, which owns more than 40 brands including Poundland in Britain, admitted “accounting irregularities” last month, sparking an 85% share price slide that wiped more than $10 billion off its market capitalisation. Commenting on a meeting with creditors, Steinhoff said it expected to give a quarterly trading update at the end of February.
