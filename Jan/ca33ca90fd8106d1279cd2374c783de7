Thank for listening to the TechCentral podcast. In this episode, Duncan McLeod talks to MTN South Africa chief technology and information officer Giovanni Chiarelli about the operator’s 5G trial. In the podcast, Chiarelli explains why MTN conducted the trial and what it learnt from it. He explores the road to 5G, and the challenges that still need to overcome — in both the global and South African contexts. Chiarelli talks about what MTN achieved in its 5G trial, which it conducted in partnership with network equipment manufacturer Ericsson, and what the future holds for the technology
What frequencies will 5G use, how will it be deployed, who will use it and how much will it cost? Chiarelli answers all these questions, and more. He talks about what MTN achieved in its 5G trial, which it conducted in partnership with network equipment manufacturer Ericsson, and what the future holds for the technology. He explains why network function virtualisation, or NFV, is key to 5G and what it means for the deployment of connectivity as a service in the cloud. Chiarelli also talks about the spectrum challenges that MTN and other operators face in South Africa. Also, he goes into detail about when the first 5G handsets are likely to reach the market. It’s an excellent insight into the future of the mobile industry. Don’t miss it! Also, don’t miss TechCentral’s 2017 interview with Chiarelli, soon after he took on the technology role at MTN South Africa, on the technological challenges of running a modern mobile network.
