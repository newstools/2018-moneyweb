Equities have greeted 2018 with a bang, but none more so than Korean pharmaceutical maker Celltrion, which has piled on about 9 trillion won ($8.4 billion) of market value in just seven days. The surge has seen Incheon-based Celltrion — which makes most of its money manufacturing copies of drugs whose patents have expired — streak past Hyundai Motor, South Korea’s largest automaker, to become the third-biggest company by value on the country’s stock exchange. Its 37 trillion won market cap puts it behind smartphone behemoth Samsung at No. 1 and chip giant SK Hynix in second place. In fact, SK Hynix’s 53 trillion-won market cap is now about equal to the combined value of Celltrion and its two subsidiaries Celltrion Healthcare and Celltrion Pharm.  There’s a couple of reasons behind the leap. Celltrion launched a new drug for treating blood cancer in Europe last year, which analysts say got a good reception, bolstering the company’s prospects. Speculation that Korea plans to boost investment in the small-cap Kosdaq market — where Celltrion is listed — has also fueled gains. The shares have rallied every day but one in 2018, after more than doubling last year. “This stock has long been a target for short sellers who had doubts over the company’s business,” said Han Byung-hwa, an analyst with Eugene Investment & Securities in Seoul, said by phone. “But shorts haven’t been able to withstand the buying.” © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
