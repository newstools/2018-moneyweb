The rand retreated from a two-and-a-half year high on Friday as a rally driven by a weaker dollar and optimism about the prospects for change under the new leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) ran out of steam. At 1541 GMT, the rand was 0.6% weaker on the day at 12.21 to the dollar. Earlier in the day it hit its strongest since June 2015 and was still on course for gains of around 1.2% this week despite Friday’s losses. “The rand is exceptionally strong after the ‘Cyril honeymoon’, so we’re seeing some consolidation after recent gains,” said Phillip Pearce, a currency dealer at TreasuryOne. The rand has risen over 7% against the greenback since mid-December when Cyril Ramaphosa won the race to succeed President Jacob Zuma as leader of the ANC. Ramaphosa has promised to fight corruption and kick-start economic growth. But some analysts are sceptical that he will deliver on those pledges, given that the ANC remains hugely divided on major policy issues and on whether Zuma should step down early to allow Ramaphosa greater room to pursue reforms. On the equities market, the Johannesburg All Share Index was little changed on Friday at 60 912 points, while the Top 40 Index inched up 0.09% to 54 058 points. Wal-Mart’s South African unit Massmart closed 2.84% lower at R140.4o, clothing and homeware retailer The Foschini Group fell 2.43% to R184.89, while rival Mr Price declined 2.31% to R252.24. “Retailers and banks that have been strong over the last couple of days are taking a breather this afternoon. It’s a typical Friday afternoon, where you find a lot of the traders will take profit where stocks have run hard,” Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods said. Government bonds were steady, with the yield on the benchmark 2026 instrument flat at 8.49%.
