Samsung Electronics Co said it will unveil its next flagship smartphone line, dubbed the Galaxy S9, during the Mobile World Congress on February 25 in Barcelona. Bloomberg News reported last month that the device would be launched in late February. The phone will look similar to the existing Galaxy S8 line, but will include an upgraded camera system, people familiar with the matter said last month. The new models will hit the market just months after Apple’s iPhone X, the main competitor to the high-end Samsung smartphone. © 2018 Bloomberg
