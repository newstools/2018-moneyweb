Cape Town has brought forward by one week to April 22 its estimate for “Day Zero,” when the drought-stricken South African city will cut off water supplies unless residents reduce consumption and additional sources come online. That’s the projected “day the taps will be turned off,” the City of Cape Town said on its website Tuesday. Dams supplying the city with water are at 29.7% of capacity, down from 31% a week earlier. Fifty four percent of Cape Town residents are using the targeted 87 litres or less each a day, compared with 34% a week earlier.
