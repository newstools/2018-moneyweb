Wall Street’s main indexes edged lower on Thursday as declines in healthcare and energy stocks paused a rally that had driven the Dow to its fastest ever 1 000 point gain. Pfizer fell 0.9% and Amgen dropped more than 1%, knocking 0.34% off the S&P healthcare sector. The S&P energy index fell 0.16% as oil slipped towards $69 a barrel on a reported rise in US fuel stocks. Alcoa shares sank 8.21% after the aluminum producer’s quarterly earnings missed analysts’ estimates. Morgan Stanley wrapped up earnings season for the big US banks with a better-than-expected adjusted profit, but its shares slipped 0.43%. “Fourth quarter in terms of net interest margins for money center banks were better than expected, so that’s good news. And with interest rates rising, the outlook for financials are pretty good,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston. At 9:45 a.m. ET (1445 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.44 points, or 0.07%, at 26 098.21, the S&P 500 was down 1.18 points, or 0.04%, at 2 801.38 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.11 points, or 0.08%, at 7 292.17. Economic data in the day was mixed. US homebuilding fell more than expected in December, recording its biggest drop in just over a year, while weekly jobless claims dropped to a 45-year low last week. Earlier in the day, data from China showed its economic growth accelerated for the first time in seven years, putting world stocks on a firm footing. “Economic data continues to accelerate both domestically and globally and that is certainly among the key drivers in the market,” Hogan said.
