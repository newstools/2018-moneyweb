Christo Wiese has confirmed his attendance at the Parliamentary inquiries into the allegations of fraud and corruption at Steinhoff which begins today in Cape Town. Wiese will be part of a full delegation from Steinhoff that includes the following directors and current executives: Supervisory Board Heather Sonn (acting chairperson) Johan van Zyl (chair of the board’s independent sub-committee) Steve Booysen (chair of the board’s audit committee) Management Board Danie van der Merwe (acting CEO) Louis du Preez (commercial director) Wiese, who resigned as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the group in December, is also the single largest shareholder of the company. His son, Jacob, who was also a board member, resigned at the same time to remove conflicts of interest in the wake of the company instituting an investigation into “accounting irregularities” that prompted the resignation of CEO Markus Jooste. Markus Jooste will not be attending the inquiry. Multiple sub-committees in parliament have launched an inquiry into what happened at Steinhoff which resulted in the company losing 90% of its value since the end of November, before the admissions were made.  Virtually every South African investment manager and retirement fund was invested in Steinhoff at the time. It is expected that much time and attention will be focused on what the audit committee of the board led by Steve Booysen, knew, or did not know, of the allegations of fraud and accounting manipulation at the company.
