President Jacob Zuma said on Tuesday he would set up a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in the government and state institutions. The presidentâ€™s move follows a court ruling on December 13 that required a commission to be set up within 30 days to carry out such an inquiry. That order upheld a recommendation in a 2016 report by the then Public Protector, whose role is to protect standards in public life.
