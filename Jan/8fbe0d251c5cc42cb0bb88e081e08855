The roller coaster January for cryptocurrency investors showed no signs of ending on Thursday as Bitcoin swung back to a loss in London trading just hours after staging a recovery above the $10 000 mark. The largest digital currency was down 2.4% to $11 107 at 9:07 am in London, Bloomberg composite pricing showed. Bitcoin held steady for much of the Asia trading day as investors took a breath following a frantic 24 hours in which it swung through a trading range of $2 600. Rivals ethereum and litecoin both fell more than 4% while Ripple was up 4.5%.  “This market is volatile and there is not enough capital in it to stabilise,” Darren Franceschini, chief executive with Blockchain Technologies Consulting, said in an e-mail. Bitcoin’s gyrations in early 2018 has investors, regulators and onlookers debating whether the speculative bubble has popped after a 1 400% ascent last year. While it staged multiple comebacks in 2017 following double-digit losses, the digital coin has not been able to string together a rally through the first three weeks of this year. Cryptocurrencies across the board are coming under increasing scrutiny from regulators around the world, with South Korean authorities debating a potential ban on local exchanges while China is widening its crackdown on the industry. Bixin, one of China’s larger operators for the so-called wallets that hold digital coins, said it was suspending all OTC trading and escrow trading on Wednesday, blaming “uncertainties regarding regulation policies.” No re-start date was set.
