I am 32, use a 10X pension umbrella fund and since 2015, have accumulated an investment value of R1.2 million. I am planning to financially emigrate by the end of 2019 and I am wondering if it would not be better to resign, cash out the pension and then move it overseas as part of the annual R1 million discretionary allowance? Based on the tax table, I would take a knock of about R300 000 in taxes and would be able to move R900 000 overseas (France). The thought is that over the next two years the rand will continue to devalue and by moving it overseas I protect myself from forex fluctuations. Investment return on the fund is 10%, whereas my overseas investment is currently at 15%.  There are a few questions that need to be answered, and it’s important to establish an accurate timeline, as it may help you make a better decision. Firstly, with your emigration, the question that needs to be asked is, will it be permanent? Is there a possibility that you might return in a few years, or, if you perhaps hold a dual-citizenship, then would it be a permanent emigration? I am asking because you mentioned that you are concerned about the rand depreciating, and it alludes to the fact that you could be returning. In my mind, someone who is concerned about the rand devaluing has not entirely made up their mind. The reason this time-frame question needs to be asked is if your emigration might only be temporary (it might sound odd but it does happen; people do come back), then it might be in your best interest to move your pension fund into a preservation fund, which basically preserves your investment without any tax implications. You will still be allowed to make a once-off withdrawal up to the total value at any time, and the pension fund, as it stands, will still be fixed until 55, but it provides a lot more flexibility. You also continue receiving the benefit of tax-free growth within the preservation fund structure, so it might not be a bad idea to hold on to your pension fund for a year or two, as it provides you with a bit of time until you really understand the direction you will be heading. Should you formally emigrate, you will be required to open a non-resident bank account, and ensure that your tax affairs are in order, before you can receive your capital (that is if your pension fund has been transferred to a preservation fund). If you decide to take the plunge, and withdraw fully prior to emigration, this process will be a lot quicker with less hassle, and is probably the best option in terms of efficiency. I have dealt with emigration cases whereby it took more than six months to withdraw, due to delays at Sars, and translation issues (the investor was living overseas). If your emigration will be permanent, then it only makes sense to withdraw now, and take the capital with you to France. As you’ve mentioned, you will be taxed quite highly, but just so that the other readers understand, here is how the tax is calculated. 2018 tax year (March 1 2017 – February 28 2018) Taxable income (R) Rate of Tax 0 – 25 000 0% 25 001 – 660 000 18% of taxable income above 25 000 660 001 – 990 000 114 300 + 27% of taxable income above 660 000 990 001 and above 203 400 + 36% of taxable income above 990 000 * This is also referred to as a withdrawal benefit table (pre-retirement) Based on a value of R1 200 000, the tax is worked out as follows: R1 200 000 – R25 000 (the tax-free portion) = R1 175 000 As R1 175 000 falls in the highest table, you would then add R203 400 + 36% of the amount above R990 000 (R1 175 000 – R990 000 = R185 000) R203 400 + [36% x (R185 000)] R203 400 + R66 600 = R270 000 tax payable *Bear in mind, this will not apply to everyone, including individuals who have taken withdrawals before. So as you mentioned, R930 000 will be available after tax. In my opinion, it all depends on your movement. If you are formally emigrating and plan on never returning, then take the money and run. If you are still sitting on the fence, then give yourself a bit of time, as you have options available. Who knows, you might decide to return to South Africa one day.
