Provider of secure cash management and payment solutions, Cash Connect, launched South Africa’s first bulk deposit ATM (BDA) on Thursday. Speaking at the BDA launch in its offices in Sandton, joint CEO for Cash Connect Richard Phillips said the system seeks to give distribution centres and retailers a safe solution when depositing large quantities of cash and coins. The system was designed to enable business efficiency and reduce time especially with cash on delivery transactions, as far as large distribution businesses are concerned. Phillips said the system delivers the service at six times the speed of a manual operation. “The BDA replaces the manual process completely, we process that queue of drivers at an incredible speed. There’s no double counting, there’s no argument- what is counted is the value actually deposited, and this saves the driver time,” said Pierre Liebenburg, General Manager: Development and Manufacturing at Cash Connect. The system delivers the service at six times the speed of a manual operation. “It’s all electronically checked and recorded in real-time, and it’s that much more secure,” he  added. The system is accessed through a registered biometric identification system, and can process up to 800 notes and coins per minute. Liebenburg added that this is the only system that combines both bank note and coin processing.  Once cash is deposited into the system, it becomes the full responsibility of Cash Connect in case of heists or thefts, “we take the risk”, said Liebenburg.
