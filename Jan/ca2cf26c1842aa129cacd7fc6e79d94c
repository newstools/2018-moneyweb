In South Africa the bacterial disease Listeriosis has left 60 people dead, with almost 750 additional cases confirmed, according to the United Nations. It’s thought to be the largest ever outbreak of the disease linked to food poisoning, the UN health agency said in a statement on Sunday. Nearly two-thirds of the cases have occurred in Gauteng, the province that includes both Johannesburg and Pretoria and is one of the most populated regions. South Africa has implemented some measures to stem Listeriosis, such as making it a notifiable disease so that every Listeriosis-diagnosed patient must be reported, the UN said. The second-largest outbreak of the disease was in 2011, when the US had a total of 147 reported cases.
