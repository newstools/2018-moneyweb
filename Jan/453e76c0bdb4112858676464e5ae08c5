The South African civil servants union PSA said on Thursday it had teamed up with PIC, the second-largest shareholder in troubled Steinhoff , to pursue a lawsuit to recoup around $1.4 billion of pensioners’ money lost in an accounting scandal. Steinhoff, owner of more than 40 retail brands including Poundland in Britain, admitted “accounting irregularities” last month, triggering an 85% share-price slide that wiped more than $10 billion off its market capitalisation. Creditor groups of Steinhoff have been joining forces to position themselves for a potential debt restructuring at the company, people close to the matter said this week. The Public Investment Corporation (PIC), which has around R2 trillion of government employees’ pensions under its custody, is among the hardest hit by the stock price collapse as it owns about 8% of the company. “We want to recoup as much as possible and that is why we have an agreement with PIC to have a joint class action to make sure that happens… to try and recoup the losses of those investments which is standing now at R17 billion ($1.43 billion),” Tahir Maepa, deputy general manager at the Public Servants Association, or PSA, told a news conference. PSA also said documents obtained from Steinhoff painted a picture of a company with a “complete collapse” of corporate governance and “real maladministration” of its tax system. Steinhoff did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares in the company were down 8% and 6% in Johannesburg and Frankfurt. ($1 = R11.87)
