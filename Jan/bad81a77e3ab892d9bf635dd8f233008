South Africa‘s rand was weaker in early trade on Wednesday, tracking a softer euro and British pound as the previous session’s brief gains gave way to bearish sentiment that has weighed on the currency for most of the week. * At 0630 GMT the rand was 0.24 percent weaker at 12.3675 per dollar versus an overnight close of 12.3375 in New York. * While the rand did reach a two-session best of 12.2775 briefly on Tuesday, gaining around 1 percent on rumours that President Jacob Zuma has stepped down, it quickly retreated to above 12.30. * The currency has traded in a narrow range in the week, leaning towards losses as it retraced the sharp gains in the final weeks of 2017 that saw it race to 2-1/2 year highs, ignoring a weak local economic outlook to outshine its EM peers. * Technical and momentum indicators also suggest the unit is due a selloff, while a rebound in demand for the dollar as lending rates there look set to rise has weighed on sentiment. * In the short term however the rand could be swayed by political developments with the rulingAfrican National Congress’s top decision-making today meeting from today and likely to decide Zuma’s fate. * “The rand is definitely outperforming its peers which means that elastic band is tightening,” said chief trader at Standard Bank Warrick Butler in a note to investors. * He added that a political outcome deemed negative by investors could see the fall as far as 12.80. * Bonds were slightly weaker with the yield on the benchmark government paper due in 2026 up 1 basis point to 8.595 percent. * Stocks were set to open slightly lower, in line with emerging market equities, with the futures index of benchmark Top-40 down 0.31 percent.
