South Africa’s new vehicle sales fell 2.4% year-on-year to 40 636 units in December, data from the trade and industry department showed on Tuesday. Exports however fell 7.1% to 17 374 units compared with the same month a year earlier, the department said.  Industry body Naamsa said in a statement on Tuesday that it anticipates further modest improvement in domestic new vehicle sales during 2018 as well as further growth in vehicle exports and industry production numbers.  “Several recent economic indicators support the view that the South African economy is performing better than anticipated despite low levels of business and consumer confidence. Barring a further credit rating downgrade, an improvement in economic growth from about 1.0% in 2017 to around 1.9% in 2018 remains possible and this would lend support to new vehicle sales in the domestic market.”
