Something odd has happened in US markets in recent days, and it may be a sign that it’s time to start worrying about the stock rally, according to Citigroup Inc. While the S&P 500 Index has extended record highs, high-yield credit spreads have been widening a little, and implied volatility has been ticking up.  “Especially the latter is odd and usually only occurs in an equity market dip, at least a small one, and not a rally,” strategists including Jeremy Hale wrote in a note to clients Friday. “We are monitoring the moves in credit and equity volatility as another potentially bearish tactical signal for stocks.” Stocks across the world have had a strong start to the year, helped by bullish sentiment on broadening global growth and a positive earnings season so far. However, investors have shifted money out of junk-bond funds on concerns about the impact of higher interest rates. The yield on the US10-year Treasury note climbed to the highest level since 2014 in the past week. The “odd” cross-asset price action comes on top of a number of other possible warning signs for equities, including stretched individual investor sentiment and very positive analyst earnings revisions, the strategists wrote. © 2018 Bloomberg
