Ecsponent was the best-performing share in Moneyweb’s stock pick competition last year. The small-cap financial services business jumped 177%, from 13c to 36c per share. The competition, which has been running over a decade, offers the Moneyweb community a chance to show off their stock-picking skills (and luck). It is an informal competition, with no prizes other than bragging rights. At the beginning of the year, each entrant chooses one JSE-listed company. The best performer for the year wins. The stock was chosen by Moneyweb reader Randall Williams. With a market value of R389 million, Ecsponent is off the radar of most institutional investors. Ecsponent has raised nearly R1 billion by selling preference shares to retail investors. The majority of these shares, worth R582 million, pay a return of 70% after five years, or 12.5% a year. The price of this funding suggests the investment is riskier than most. Ecsponent has two major assets on its balance sheet. The first is an investment in Frankfurt-listed MyBucks SA. MyBucks’s CEO is Dave van Niekerk, former CEO of Blue Financial Services. The MyBucks investment was worth R233 million on March 31 2017. Today it is only worth around R127 million. The other asset is loans to the value of R749 million that it has advanced to businesses. The loans range from between two to five years and have fixed interest rates of between 24% and 30%. Again, the interest rate suggests the risk of default to be higher than average. Ecsponent’s auditors are Nexia SAB&T. Its non-executive directors are: Richard Connellan, George Manyere, Keith Rayner, Brandon Topham, Patrick Matute and Willem Oberholzer. Rayner, Oberholzer and Topham are Saica-registered chartered accountants. To enter the competition for 2018, please complete the form below. Entries close on January 20 2018.
