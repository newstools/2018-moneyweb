Here’s what caught our attention on Wednesday: 1. KPMG dropped by the Auditor-General The Auditor General (AG) has cancelled all contracts with auditing firm KPMG, after the firm was caught up in a number of scandals relating to the controversial Gupta family and most recently VBS Mutual Bank. Two senior partners at KPMG resigned last week, after they failed to disclose details of a loan made to them by the bank. According to Reuters, the AG said the conduct of KPMG’s audit partners and the reports relating to VBS Mutual Bank prompted his decision. 2.
