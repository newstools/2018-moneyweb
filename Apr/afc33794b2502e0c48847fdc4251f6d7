A strike by South African unions to demand an increase to the proposed national minimum wage shut down vehicle manufacturing plants and disrupted public transportation in some of the nation’s main cities. The one-day national strike was called by the South African Federation of Trade Unions, a group of 30 bodies representing almost 800 000 workers that says the hourly minimum wage of R20 ($1.61) amounts to “slave labor.” It also wants the government to do more to address poverty and create jobs. Protests were staged in Johannesburg, Pretoria, the capital, and four other cities. Almost all the country’s automotive plants were shut, said Nico Vermeulen, director of the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa. Carmakers with a presence in South Africa include BMW AG, Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. “One plant in the Pretoria region is operating with skeleton staff,” Vermeulen said by phone. Company and union officials will discuss how to make up the loss of production, he said. Thirty-five percent of more than 350 companies surveyed by the National Employers Association of South Africa have been affected by the strike, with 8% experiencing a complete stay-away, according to Gerhard Papenfus, the group’s chief executive officer. State power utility Eskom Holding’s workers weren’t allowed to go on strike because it provides an essential service and its operations are continuing as normal, spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said by phone. The country’s three other biggest labor groups — the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the Federation of Unions of South Africa, and the National Council of Trade Unions — aren’t backing the strike. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
