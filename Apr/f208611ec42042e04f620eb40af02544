South Africa’s rand was on the back foot on Wednesday against the resurgent dollar but was seen in a tight range with no major domestic data in the offing and strong technical support seen kicking in soon. At 06:20 GMT, the rand was 0.40% softer against the greenback, fetching 12.38/dlr. Technical support seen around 12.45 as momentum indicators tracked by analysts suggest the rand may soon stray into oversold territory. NKC African Economics said in a morning note that currency’s expected range on the day is 12.25 to 12.45. Globally, the dollar was approaching its recent four-month high against a basket of major currencies as the US 10-year bond yield poked above 3% to hit its highest level since early 2014. A nationwide one-day strike by left-wing union Saftu is not unnerving markets at this point as other major unions have not joined and there have been no reports of violence linked to it.
