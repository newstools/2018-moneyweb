The rand weakened against the dollar on Monday, slipping to its weakest in more than two weeks in a broad sell-off of emerging market currencies as fears of a US-China trade war weighed on global risk appetite. At 1525 GMT the rand was 0.46% weaker at 12.08 per dollar compared to its opening of 11.97. The rand slipped to its weakest since March 19, and threatened to touch a 2-month low. Stocks rose, meanwhile. On Monday, China upped its retaliation to President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs. Beijing has said it would be impossible to negotiate under “current circumstances”, assigning blame to Washington for the rising tension. “It’s a big risk-off scenario, with general sell-off of emerging markets, which are under pressure as the war of words about imposing tariffs is being exchanged between the US and China,” said chief currency dealer from Treasury One, Wichard Cilliers. In the fixed income market, bonds were also weaker, with the yield on the benchmark government paper due in 2026 up 2.5 basis points to 8.08%. On the bourse, the benchmark Top 40 Index rose 0.51% to 49 391 points while the All Share Index rose 0.38% to 56 092 points. Local shares benefited from positive sentiment for emerging markets stocks, with the wider emerging market benchmark up 0.2%.
