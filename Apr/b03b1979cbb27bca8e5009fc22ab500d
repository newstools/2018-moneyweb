A successful business and leadership modus operandi takes decades to develop and refine. Gareth Ackerman has more than three decades under the belt — working not only for one of the country’s most iconic, groundbreaking retailers, but also doing it initially under the seasoned eye of Raymond Ackerman, his father and founder of the company. Ackerman senior’s entrepreneurial spirit, work ethic, community centric principles and bold, innovative approach to retailing, are embedded in Gareth Ackerman. However, he has taken these learnings forward; refining, building on them and forging his own distinctive path on the journey that is leadership. In this Quick Insight, extracted from a full length, in depth interview, Ackerman shares his personal insights on what constitutes true business leadership and the necessity for setting one’s own course.
