South Africa’s revenue service came very close to meeting its revenue collection target for last financial year, Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said on Tuesday, citing provisional data. “The preliminary result is very close to (the) forecasted estimate of R1.217 trillion ($103 billion),” Nene said at a press briefing in Pretoria. He said the preliminary data showed R1.216 trillion was collected in the year to the end of March. “One of our forecast areas should be to restore and rebuild public trust and credibility. It is critical that all taxpayers and citizens have full confidence that every cent provided to the fiscus will be well spent,” Nene said. The revenue service missed its revenue target for the 2016-17 financial year, a gap the Treasury said was partially to blame for the nearly R49 billion budget shortfall. Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa suspended the head of the SARS revenue service, Tom Moyane, pending disciplinary action, citing a deterioration in public confidence over numerous scandals. The Treasury said in February it would raise value-added tax to 15% from 14% to generate an additional R23 billion of revenue.
