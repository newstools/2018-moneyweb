Business confidence fell for the second month in a row in March, in a sign that momentum in the economy has slowed since a sharp rebound in the wake of Cyril Ramaphosa’s election as leader of the ruling African National Congress. The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (Sacci) monthly business confidence index (BCI) declined by 1.3 index points to 97.6 in March from 98.9 in February, a survey showed on Thursday. Lower import volumes, weaker retail sales growth and a subdued construction sector contributed negatively to the business climate. That was partly offset by increased exports, lower financing costs and lower inflation. “The business and economic climate remained favourable in the first few months of 2018 and there was a serious attempt to eradicate the most obvious maladministration and financial mismanagement in the public sector,” Sacci said in a statement. “Although there is greater hope for economic policy certainty and a pivotal role for the business, the current positive climate and momentum of business confidence should be supplemented by tangible results.” Business confidence jumped after Ramaphosa’s election as ANC leader in December. He later replaced scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as president, raising expectations that South Africa will see reforms, but attention has started to turn to whether he can follow through on promises to revamp the economy. Although South Africa recently avoided a downgrade to “junk” status by ratings agency Moody’s, there are lingering concerns over the health of struggling state firms like Eskom and South African Airways. Those concerns, coupled with worries over the country’s budget deficit, have dragged on business confidence.
