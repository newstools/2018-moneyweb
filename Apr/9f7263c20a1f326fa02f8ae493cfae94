Standard Bank Group has awarded David Munro, which it installed as CEO of subsidiary Liberty Holdings last year, a R20 million incentive to stay in that position for five years. Munro will be paid R10 million on completion of three years at Liberty and the remainder after five years. This is on top of the R15.944 million in remuneration (guaranteed pay and short-term incentives) Munro was paid for the first five months of the year as CEO of Standard Bank’s Corporate and Investment Bank division. Of his total reward for 2017 of R40 944 million, the bank says “74.2% (R30 400 million) will be deferred for up to five years”. This is comprised of the R20 million special incentive, R5.4 million in deferred short-term incentives linked to shares and R5 million in long-term incentives awarded under its performance reward plan (PRP). Separately, Munro also received historical awards that had vested under the PRP and equity growth scheme in 2017. These totalled R25.928 million. At Liberty, Munro was paid R8.519 million (in fixed remuneration and short-term incentives) for his seven months as CEO. He was awarded “restricted shares to the value of R9 million relating to performance for 2017”. Liberty, in its integrated report, notes that “as part of David Munro’s appointment as group chief executive, he was assured of guaranteed remuneration offerings to ensure that he was fairly remunerated for the change in his role and responsibilities”. As part of a once-off award under a special retention mechanism “he was further awarded equity growth scheme rights with a Black Scholes value of R8.2 million, in addition to his take-on award of equity growth scheme rights with a Black Scholes value of R16.2 million”. It must be remembered that Munro (was) moved from a position where his total remuneration (excluding long-term incentives) was around R35 million a year, historically. At Liberty, this will be significantly lower (former CEO Thabo Dloti was paid R9.3 million in 2016, for example). The insurer says that in order to make the move possible, “given the differences in the scale and therefore remuneration of the different positions, Standard Bank agreed to fully fund past Standard Bank deferred incentives, including long-term awards, granted to David Munro prior to his transfer to Liberty”. This policy applied to former financial director Casper Troskie as well (who moved from Standard Bank in 2010). Under Standard Bank’s deferred bonus scheme, performance reward plan, equity growth scheme and its wealth & investment medium-term incentive scheme, Munro has total awards valued at R106.5 million as at end-2017 (at a share price of R195.66). The share price has since appreciated by 15%. In its remuneration report, the bank says it will settle three tranches of awards in the deferred bonus scheme made to a number of directors and prescribed officers, including Munro, in cash. These were made on March 2 2017 for the 2016 financial year, and total R9.96 million (plus R300 000 in notional dividends) for Munro. Dloti, who quit Liberty with immediate effect on May 30 2017, was paid a separation payment of R19 095 856 last year. His fixed remuneration was R4.348 million. He had 346 531 shares under its restricted share plans as at the start of 2017, valued at R39 million. Liberty cited a “difference of opinion with the board on the immediate focus of the company at a time when the organisation is facing tough operational and environmental challenges” as a reason for Dloti’s departure.
