Nedbank Group chief executive Mike Brown’s total remuneration fell 2.3% to R38.12 million in 2017, as short-term incentives awarded to executive management were adjusted in line with the group’s performance. Mike Brown’s Pay Source: Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2017 The banking group’s short-term incentive pool dipped by 0.3% to R2.38 billion in 2017, as overall headline earnings grew by 2.8% in 2017 compared with 5.9% in 2016. Group headline earnings were hit by the underperformance of Nedbank’s pan-African unit Ecobank Transnational Incorporated (ETI), headquartered in Togo, with headline earnings from managed operations increasing by 7.8%. Nedbank profit and earnings versus short-term incentives Source: Nedbank Group Integrated Report 2017 Nedbank’s 2017 short-term incentive spend comprises 12.7% of headline earnings from managed operations – pre-bonus and pre-tax – compared with 13.1% in 2016. “Consistent with previous years, the short-term incentive pool is funded more closely, but not exclusively, by the performance of the managed operations, which was in line with targets set for the year. The group’s lower headline earnings growth and underperformance from ETI have resulted in a further decline in the Group Exco sharing of the total short-term incentive pool from 4.2% to 4.0%, with the short-term incentive awarded to the chief executive (Mike Brown) down 5.2%, compared with that in 2016,” it said in its 2017 Integrated Report. The group’s short-term incentive scheme rewards a “combination of profitable returns, appropriate risk taking and growth”, with 2017’s awards based on performance against pre-agreed targets and individual scorecards incorporating financial and non-financial measures, it said. The pay packages of Brown’s fellow executive directors Raisibe Morathi and Mfundo Nkuhlu’s also dipped in 2017. Chief financial officer Morathi’s total remuneration fell 0.6% to R21.76 million while that of chief operating officer Nkuhlu fell 0.8% to R25.74 million. Differences in annual pay among divisional heads varied. Managing executive for Retail and Business Banking Ciko Thomas’ pay increased 14.9% to R17.99 million. Brian Kennedy, managing executive for Corporate and Investment Banking, received R36.25 million, up 4.4% from the prior year. Iolanda Ruggiero, managing executive for Nedbank Wealth, saw her pay decrease by 3.2% to R12.85 million. Total pay to the group’s 18 non-executive directors increased to just over R20 million from R17.32 million. Of the total pay, R12.25 million comprised Nedbank and Nedbank Group board fees with the remaining R7.77 million making up committee fees. Nedbank said it paid R12.8 billion in remuneration and benefits – net of taxes – to its 31 887 employees. “To reduce the wealth gap we deliberately provided for average salary increases at 8.0% and 5.0%, for our unionised staff and higher management respectively.” The minimum guaranteed package for permanent full-time employees in South Africa increased to R142 000 per annum, which the bank said is at the “higher end” of pay within financial services and “significantly higher” than the minimum wage. Following engagement with shareholders, the banking group outlined some changes to executive remuneration. Effective for long-term incentives this year, the three-year average diluted headline earnings per share (Dheps) growth metric will replace the three-year Fini 15 performance metric and in doing so improve alignment with the group medium- to long-term targets. Shareholders are to vote on a proposal to extend the performance condition of the Nedbank’s matched-share scheme to 100%, which is currently at 50%, for all members of the group Exco at the May 2018 Annual General Meeting. A vote to amend the share scheme rules to reduce the number of shares available for use in the schemes from 10% to 5%, will also take place.
