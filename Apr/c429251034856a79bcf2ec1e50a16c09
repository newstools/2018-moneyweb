South African stocks and the country’s currency recovered Tuesday as investor jitters over a US-China trade row eased, boosting risk appetite, even as local manufacturing data pointed to a slow recovery in the domestic economy. At 1501 GMT, the rand traded at 12.04 per dollar, up 0.43% from Monday’s close of 12.09. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday promised to open the country’s economy further and lower import tariffs on products, in a speech seen as conciliatory amid rising trade tensions between China and the United States. The rand held its gains despite data showing South Africa’s factory output missed estimates in February, following five months of robust growth. “The latest set of economic statistics suggests that the economy is recovering, but only at a moderate pace and in a patchy manner,” Nedbank analysts said. “The economy is still expected to fare better than last year, but the recovery will probably remain gradual.” Xi’s speech also prompted a largely positive reaction in stocks and commodities, which have been rattled over the past week on fears the tit-for-tat US-China tariffs would explode into a full-scale trade war. “For now, it looks like the speech has defused the ‘trade wars’, global futures are higher and commodity prices are higher,” Vestact said in a note. The blue-chip JSE Top 40 Index gained 1.31% to 50 036 and the broader All Share Index added 1.17% to 56 747. Mining heavyweights Anglo American and BHP Billiton rose 6% and 4%, respectively. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond rose 2.5 basis points to 8.105%, reflecting weaker bond prices.
