I’m in the process of loaning money to my daughter, to build a house in a new development area in White River. How can I protect myself in the matter? There has to be a written agreement on the interest that they’ll pay me monthly. They’ll pay back capital, but if they decided to sell the house, the capital that I put in has to come back to me. I want to stipulate that in a contract. What’s the tax impact to me? I want to make it clear that it’s not a donation but a loan. What if the sudden drop in investment capital prompted such a question from Sars (donation vs loan)? At the outset it should be put forward that I am not a legal or tax expert but hopefully have sufficient understanding of the dynamics at hand to give you some guidance. Please note the information provided below does not constitute financial advice. Generic information has been applied in the context of your question. We have very limited detail about you and your circumstances; such detail may impact any advice provided. After asking around it appears that there is no obligation for you to charge interest on a ‘family loan’, but it is certainly reasonable as you are losing out on a return that would have been earned on the cash if it remained in your hands. Any interest received by you would be taxable in your hands. The loan agreement itself should provide validity to the arrangement and it should not be viewed as a donation, whether or not interest is being paid, as a valid agreement is in place. I will also give you some other ideas, detailed below, that could add robustness to the arrangement. Here are a few points to consider when drafting the loan agreement as well as some other related thoughts: We would suggest engaging with an attorney who has the necessary skill and experience to draft the agreement, taking into account your specific needs, while alerting you to the various available options as well as the pitfalls. Good Luck!
