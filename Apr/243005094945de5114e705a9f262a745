Here’s what caught our attention on Friday: 1. Court day for Zuma They say the wheels of justice are turning, as former President Jacob Zuma made an appearance in the Durban High Court on Friday, where it was decided that his case would be postponed to June 8.  Zuma is being charged for money laundering, racketeering, fraud and corruption. These were all allegedly committed prior to his presidency, and were pursued by the National Prosecuting Authority about a month after Zuma was ousted by his own party as the country’s president. 2. Steinhoff bonuses shelved Lawmakers involved in the Steinhoff case have indicated that bonuses paid to executive directors are to be shelved, given the current financial state of the retailer. Steinhoff lost more than 90% of its market value when its accounting irregularities were made public, Bloomberg reported. 3. Consol returns to the JSE With a glass-shattering 70% market share, glass-packaging company Consol has decided to make a comeback to the JSE. The company CEO, Mike Arnold, said the decision to re-list Consol comes with its plans to expand the business into the rest of Africa and simplify its capital structure. Moneyweb reported that Consol will list in May. 4.Eskom to approach court on McKinsey and Trillian buyout Power-utility Eskom has indicated that it will approach courts to recover about R1.6 billion in “unlawful payments” made to consultancy firm McKinsey and Gupta-linked Trillian. EWN reported that the payments were made without valid contracts. McKinsey said if the payments are found to be unlawful, it will make due payment. 5.The rand is doing flip-flops On Friday, the rand weakened against the dollar, around trade war fears between  the US and China.
