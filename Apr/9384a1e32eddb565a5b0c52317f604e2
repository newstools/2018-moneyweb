A wall of institutional money will drive the markets much higher.” The fund, which started investing in Bitcoin in 2014, has only made three buy and one sell recommendations in seven years, the note said. The new call comes after Bitcoin crossed its 200-day moving average.  “Traders often use that time period as it seems to be the optimal response time of human psychology,” the report said. “Long enough to stop fretting about missing the trade. Not too long that the information is lost.” © 2018 Bloomberg
