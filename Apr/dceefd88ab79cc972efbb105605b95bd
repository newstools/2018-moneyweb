The rand strengthened and bonds rallied on Wednesday after better than expected inflation and retail data reactivated investor optimism that has bolstered the currency this year. Stocks ended higher, led by heavily weighted mining shares as commodity prices forged ahead. At 1500 GMT the rand was 0.42% firmer at 11.93 against the US dollar, a touch softer than the session-best 11.92 but its strongest in a week, as investors cheered the March inflation figure sliding to its lowest in seven years on falling food prices. The rand has strengthened by about 20% against the dollar since November, when Cyril Ramaphosa won the race to lead the ruling African National Congress en route to his election as South Africaâ€™s president in February. The yield on the benchmark government bond due in 2026 fell 5.5 basis points to 8.025%, its lowest since April 5.
