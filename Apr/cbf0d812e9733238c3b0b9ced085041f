Wall Street slid on Thursday morning, weighed down by a broad-based slump in technology stocks from Apple to chipmakers as well as a tumble in consumer staples such as Procter & Gamble. A warning from Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), the world’s largest contract chipmaker and an Apple supplier, on soft demand for smartphones and on the semiconductor industry’s growth this year sparked a tumble in chip stocks. TSMC’s US-listed shares fell 5.2%. Intel declined 2.2% and Nvidia sank 1.7%. Each of the stocks on the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index was in the red, with the index down 2.7%. Apple shares also fell 1.8%, with at least two analysts blaming the decline on TSMC’s warning. The stock was the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. At 9:54 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 92.72 points, or 0.37%, at 24 655.35, the S&P 500 was down 13.44 points, or 0.50%, at 2 695.20 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 38.37 points, or 0.53%, at 7 256.87. The consumer staples sector declined 2.5%. The biggest drag was a 12.5% drop in Philip Morris after its revenue missed estimates. Also weighing was Procter & Gamble, which dropped 3.2% after the Dow component said shrinking retailer inventories and higher commodities and transportation costs squeezed its margins. Still, not everything was gloomy. American Express was up 3.4% after the credit card issuer topped Wall Street profit estimates. That led the financial sector 0.8 higher, making it the only gainer among the 11 major S&P sectors. Amazon gained 2.1% after the e-commerce retailer said it now has more than 100 million Amazon Prime members globally. “We are in a digestion period where we are inundated with massive amounts of information. On balance, things look great, the (profit) growth rate is at mid 20% on S&P,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in Boston. Of the 52 companies among the S&P 500 that have reported first-quarter earnings through Wednesday, 78.8% topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall profits at S&P 500 companies are expected to have increased 19.4% in the first quarter, the biggest in seven years. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2.08-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.40-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 66 new highs and 32 new lows.
