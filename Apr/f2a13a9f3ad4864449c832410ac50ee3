Indonesia, home to roughly 6% of Facebook’s users, isn’t happy with the social-media giant. Officials there are even threatening to shut the service down after its latest egregious privacy scandal. All this might appear inefficient. But social commerce solves two key problems in emerging markets. First, it offers a low-cost way for entrepreneurs to sell online. Rather than set up a website — which can be expensive and burdensome for small merchants — they simply establish a Facebook page or join a Buy and Sell Group. In countries such as Vietnam and Ghana, where joining the internet is synonymous with joining Facebook and WhatsApp, the network effects far outmatch traditional e-commerce players. Second, social media provides a solution to the rampant distrust and fraud that inhibits online commerce in developing regions. Rather than buy a mobile phone from a nameless merchant behind a website, consumers can purchase one from someone they know within their social network, or from businesses that can demonstrate social approval via comments and likes. Social commerce on Facebook emerged mostly by accident, but the company has lately started to formalize it. In 2016, it launched a feature called Marketplace, which allows users to browse a searchable carousel of goods for sale locally (and then to haggle over them via Messenger). So far it’s available in 68 countries — including India, Thailand and the Philippines — with more rollouts planned in coming months, a company spokesperson told me. Of course, Facebook’s grip on emerging markets may not be permanent. Improved logistics and better digital payment systems could eventually erode its attractiveness for small businesses, in favor of Amazon-style marketplaces. But until then, the social network remains indispensable for emerging-market countries — whether their governments like it or not. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
