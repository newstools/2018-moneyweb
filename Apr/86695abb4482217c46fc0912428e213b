President Cyril Ramaphosa said his administration was committed to fighting corruption and fixing troubled state companies, but progress would take time. Since succeeding Jacob Zuma as president two months ago, Ramaphosa has been on a drive to convince investors of his commitment to reverse years of economic stagnation, policy uncertainty and the plunder of state funds. He’s fired some of Zuma’s ministers and replaced the boards of the state power utility, passenger rail agency and state weapons company.

Total fixed investment in South Africa declined to about 19% of gross domestic product last year, from 24% in 2008, with foreign direct investment dropping to R17.6 billion from R76 billion over the period, government data shows.  Ramaphosa said his government would tackle the thorny issue of land ownership without disrupting the economy. His ANC agreed in December to back land seizures. “We won’t damage the economy,” he said. “The land drive should not lead to a reduction in agricultural production or endanger food production.” After 24 years of democratic rule, it’s time to address land hunger among black South Africans, he said. “We have not moved quickly enough in addressing the question of land,” Ramaphosa said. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
