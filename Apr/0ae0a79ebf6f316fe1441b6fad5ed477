Moneyweb financial journalist, Prinesha Naidoo, has scooped the 2018 Citi Journalistic Excellence Award for South Africa. The awards, which have been running since 1982, aim to recognise journalists for excellence in financial and business reporting in more than 20 markets in which Citi does business around the world. Independent panels assembled by Citi assess each entry. The Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in the US screens those nominated and selects the winner for each territory. Naidoo submitted an article called Banks vs Life Insurers: don’t fall for the PE trap. The article unpacked the investment thesis for each sector, but did so in a way that made a complex subject accessible to the average reader. In a jargon-fuelled sector this is not always easy. Entrants are also required to motivate their entry in a 1 000-word essay. Naidoo’s motivation said more about what she still had to learn about the world of finance and investment, than about what she knows. “This award is probably one of the more prestigious for financial journalists in South Africa as it forms part of an international competition,” says Moneyweb editor Ryk van Niekerk. “It is a fantastic achievement for any journalist and underlines the hard work Prinesha has put in over the years and the quality of the journalism she produces.” The most prominent aspect of the award is the winners’ participation in an eight-day business and financial seminar in New York City, which is hosted by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and sponsored by Citi. The programme offers participants rigorous workshops in the principles of accounting and finance, and exposure to institutions, policy makers, and other thought leaders in the US. Since its inception, more than 340 talented journalists from more than 100 media outlets in 39 countries have attended the seminar.
