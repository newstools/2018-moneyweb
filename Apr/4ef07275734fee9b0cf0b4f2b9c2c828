South Africa’s Imperial Holdings said on Wednesday Chief Executive Officer Mark Lamberti will resign at the end of the month following a court judgement against him involving a remarks he made to an ex-employee at one of its units. Current CEO of the Motus division Osman Arbee will replace Lamberti at the start of May, the company said in a statement. The company’s board said in addition to finding that the ex-employee had suffered damages arising from dismissal, Lamberti was found to have impaired the dignity of the ex-employee during a conversation in April 2015. Lamberti apologised over the incident with the employee, the company said. Imperial shares were down 0.3% to R236 at 09:07 GMT. Lamberti resigned from the board of power utility Eskom earlier this month. Lamberti was not available for immediate comment.
