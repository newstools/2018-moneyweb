Manufacturing output rose 0.6% year-on-year in February, well below expectations of a 2.6% expansion, while monthly output was down 2.4%, the statistics agency said on Tuesday. The declines were seen in the plastics and petroleum sectors as well as in publishing and printing. Production of food products, furniture and motor vehicles however remained positive, accounting for the marginally positive annual figure. “It has been a patchy recovery for the industry especially if look at the world recovery that began already in 2017.

All of that is holding back this recovery,” she said.
