Old Mutual Plc’s shareholders received their final road map for businesses that are going their separate ways. The London-based insurer, founded in South Africa in 1845, is splitting its four financial-services businesses through what it calls a managed separation, and on Friday it gave final details on what shareholders will get. It is hiving off its wealth management unit, emerging-markets business and Johannesburg-based lender Nedbank Group after concluding that the company’s shares trade at a discount to the total value of the individual assets. In November, it completed the disposal of its US-based OM Asset Management division, which has since re-branded itself as BrightSphere Investment Group Plc. When first announcing the plan to shareholders in March 2016, Chief Executive Officer Bruce Hemphill joked that he was effectively working himself out of the job. The split is the culmination of a strategic review started by Hemphill when he took the post in November 2015, in an effort to boost profitability and reignite a share price that was trailing its peers. That day is closer, with Hemphill saying most of the work will be done by the end of the first half, ahead of schedule. Here are the steps outlined in statements issued by Old Mutual on Friday: The company is proposing to offer one share in Quilter and three OML shares for every three Old Mutual shares, according to the statement. While the final value still has to be determined, at current market prices OML shareholders would receive three Nedbank shares for every 100 OML shares they own. A shareholder meeting will be held on May 25 to vote on the proposals. “We are on track with our listing as part of the managed separation process,” OML CEO Peter Moyo said. “The listing of OML on the JSE will signal the return of Old Mutual to Africa.” © 2018 Bloomberg
