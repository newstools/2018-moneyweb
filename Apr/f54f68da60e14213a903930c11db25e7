At 06:25 GMT, the rand traded at 12.01 versus the dollar, around 0.2% weaker than its New York close on Tuesday. The dollar index rose. The rand gained in the previous two sessions, buoyed by the announcement of an investment drive by President Cyril Ramaphosa and strong Chinese data, which boosted emerging markets. The International Monetary Fund lifted South Africa’s economic growth forecast on Tuesday, citing the election of a new political leadership. Ramaphosa, who has pledged to revamp the local economy, recently appointed a team of finance experts to scour the globe for investment.
