The rand tumbled to its weakest in more than the three months and bonds also fell, as a rally in the dollar and US Treasuries battered emerging currencies and stocks on Wednesday. At 1530 GMT the rand was down 1.1% at 12.46 per dollar, its weakest since January 10, after hitting a low of 12.53 as emerging-market currencies dropped. The Russian rouble was down one% while the Turkish lira slipped 0.4%. “The rand has weakened a lot this week and it’s because of a lot of external risks,” said Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM. “It’s not a South Africa story,” he said, pointing to rising oil prices and worries over a breakdown in the US-Iran nuclear deal. President Donald Trump has threatened to scrap the 2015 agreement under which Iran curbed its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief, sparking a wave of risk-off sentiment globally. The dollar hit a four-month high on Wednesday after a rise in benchmark US Treasury yields above three%, leading investors to wonder whether the dollar was breaking out of a prolonged weak spell. The yield on the benchmark bond due in 2026 was up 10 basis points to 8.335%, its highest since February 14. Stocks were also weaker, with the Top40 blue-chip index down 1.3% at 50 213 points. The JSE All Share Index, the broadest measure of stock market performance, was down 1.25% at 50 234 points and the broader All Share Index fell 1.2% to 56 987 points. “Our market is reacting to a weaker close of the US market, that’s why you saw a weaker opening,” said GT247 head of trading Nilan Morar. Stocks falling the most were resources and financials tracking the currency’s tumble. Royal Bafokeng Platinum was the biggest decliner on the All-Share, 9% weaker at 22.90 rand, after World No. 1 platinum producer Anglo American Platinum sold most of its stake in Royal Bafokeng Platinum, on Wednesday . Gold stocks closed 1.74% lower. Gold Fields was down 5.08% at R46.44. The banking index was down 1.9% on the day. ABSA fell 2% to R170.95, Nedbank weakened 2.9% to R285, while Standard Bank shed 1.5% to R212.
