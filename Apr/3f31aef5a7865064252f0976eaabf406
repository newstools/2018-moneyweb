Zimbabwe’s proposals to compel miners to list the majority of their shares on the local exchange will strangle companies’ ability to invest and grow, according to the country’s biggest producer of platinum. Impala Platinum sees little interest in a listing among local investors, said Johan Theron, a spokesman for the company whose Zimplats unit is Zimbabwe’s biggest platinum producer. Investors in the country can already trade Zimplats shares listed on the Australian Securities Exchange, he said. Politicians are debating the proposals in a bill that would also require companies to use 85% of funds raised in a Zimbabwe listing to develop local rights. Platinum and diamonds are key exports for an economy that’s half the size it was in 2000 following a chaotic and violent land-reform program under former ruler Robert Mugabe.

Separately, Anglo American Platinum, the world’s biggest producer of the metal, said it will seek to work with the government to ensure the law takes account of industry views and leads to growth in the mining industry. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
