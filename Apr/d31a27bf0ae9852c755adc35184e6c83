The dollar rallied at the start of a week packed with catalysts, from economic data to new debt supply, as the yield on benchmark US Treasuries climbed toward 3%. European stocks edged lower after a broad retreat for equities across Asia. The yield on the US 10-year note climbed to 2.99 for the first time since 2014 as investors continued to weigh the outlook for international trade and growth. S&P 500 Index futures turned lower, tracking moves in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Earlier, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped. The pound joined major currencies retreating against the greenback, as UK Prime Minister Theresa May battled to avert a cabinet revolt over Brexit. As tension over trade between the US and China appears to ebb — Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said he’s “cautiously optimistic” on reaching an agreement — and North Korea pledges to dial back its nuclear ambitions, traders could be forgiven for breathing a sigh of relief. But they must now come to terms with a deepening government bond selloff that has implications for everything from company borrowing costs and the strength of the dollar to investor allocations. “Ultimately it’s hard to see a move sustained above 3% on the US 10-year,” Mitul Kotecha, a strategist at TD Securities, told Bloomberg TV from Singapore. “Some of the dialing down in tensions, in risk aversion, may be having some impact there as well as expectations of continued strong growth in the US.” Elsewhere, West Texas oil slipped after rising for a second week on a commitment from OPEC to rebalance the market. Gold edged lower. These are some important events coming up this week: Here are the main moves in markets: Stocks
