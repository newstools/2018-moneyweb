South Africa’s Clicks Group reported a 14.8% rise in half-year earnings on Thursday as health and beauty products appealed to thrifty consumers, and flagged strong full-year earnings growth. Shoppers are feeling the impact of low growth in disposable income, little job creation and tight credit conditions but promotional offers, competitive pricing and trading during the Christmas period buoyed sales. “The growth was driven mainly by buoyant Christmas trading, appealing promotional offers and competitive pricing,” Chief Executive David Kneale said in a statement. Health and beauty sales rose by 14.3% which contributed to Clicks gaining market share in all product categories, he said. The retailer forecast earnings growth of between 12 and 17% in the full-year to August. For the six months to the end of February, diluted headline earnings per share rose to 266.3 cents from 232 cents. Group turnover increased by 10% to R14.4 billion ($1 billion), while retail sales grew by 13.2%. Shareholders will receive an interim dividend of 102.5 cents per share, up 16.5%, Clicks said. Clicks shares rose 0.16% to 195.95 by 0920 GMT. Clicks is betting on the continued resilience of its core health and beauty products, and said it would open 40 new stores across the country, rather than the previous plan to increase its outlets by 25 to 30 stores. The retail group will be investing R700 million into new stores, infrastructure and information technology this year, said Kneale. ($1 = 11.9365 rand)
