South African property icon and businesswoman, Pam Golding, has died peacefully in Cape Town, aged 90. Golding turned what began as a hobby into a lifelong passion, using her flair for people, property and business to create a thriving, global property company. She launched The Pam Golding Property Group in 1976 at a time when the real estate industry was male-dominated and still somewhat of a ‘home industry’. She quickly identified a niche in the market for a discreet and professional property agency in South Africa, in the process building a reputation for selling the country’s most luxurious homes and building the integrity, trust and respect of the Pam Golding Properties brand. In 1986 she took a leap of faith by opening an office in London – at a time when the country’s international image was at its worst. Together with her son and chief executive Andrew, the business soon expanded further abroad over the following years, to more than 300 offices across Southern Africa and in various countries on the African continent, Europe and the Indian Ocean Islands. She became an inspiration to women across generations throughout South Africa and held in high regard by her peers, the property industry and the business sector at large. She will be deeply missed by her family including sons Peter and Andrew, daughter Jilly , their spouses and 10 grandchildren.
