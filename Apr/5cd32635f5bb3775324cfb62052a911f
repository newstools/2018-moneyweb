 The assets included luxury cars, farms, residences, a helicopter and two other aircraft, the NPA said in an emailed statement. The Monday raids came after the High Court in Bloemfontein in the Free State province granted an order against people and companies associated with suspected theft, fraud and money laundering related to Gupta-linked company Estina.

The regional government agreed to help develop it, but earlier this year prosecutors said most of the R220 million in public funds transferred to the company ended up in the hands of the Gupta family. In February, former Oakbay Resources and Energy  CEO Varun Gupta, former Oakbay Investments CEO Nazeem Howa, acting Oakbay Investments CEO Ronica Ragavan, and Ashu Chawla, the CEO of the Gupta family’s Sahara Computers, were among eight who were arrested on graft charges related to the farm and later granted bail. Howa’s house in Johannesburg’s Greenside suburb and five of his cars were among the assets identified for seizure, according to court documents provided by the NPA. Eleven properties linked to Ragavan were also on the list along with company-registered cars that included brands such as Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, Land Rover, Lexus and Lamborghini. The Gupta family, who have fled South Africa, have been accused of using a friendship with former President Jacob Zuma to win state contracts and influence government appointments. Zuma and the Guptas deny wrongdoing. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
