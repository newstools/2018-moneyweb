Cape Town, which is recovering from the effects of the worst drought on record, has relaxed restrictions on water use by residents. Starting Saturday, residents will each be allowed to use 105 litres a day, up from the current limit of 70 liters, the South African city’s municipality said in a statement Thursday. Residents were restricted to 50 litres a day until October 1, when curbs were relaxed as improved winter rainfall restored dam levels. Dams supplying Cape Town are at 71% of capacity, compared with 36% a year ago. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
