Retailer Pepkor previously known as Steinhoff Africa Retail (Star), said on Tuesday its full-year earnings are expected to fall as much as 42% mainly due to a provision, sending its shares more than 11% lower. The clothing and furniture retailer said in May its earnings would be affected after it made a provision of R500 million ($36 million) to cover a third-party debt acquired through using its Steinhoff International’s shares as collateral. An accounting scandal at Steinhoff that came to light in December last year wiped more than 90% off the company’s market value and forced it to sell assets. Pepkor said headline earnings per share for the year ended September 30 are expected to be between 77.8 cents per share and 91.2 cents per share compared with 133.6 cents per share in the same period a year ago. Shares in Pepkor were down 5.87% to R17.33 after initially falling more than 11%. “If you look at what has come out it’s not exactly stellar numbers. These things tend to get hammered on the basis of expectations,” Ryan Woods, market trader at Independent Securities, said.
