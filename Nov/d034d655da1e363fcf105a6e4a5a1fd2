The rand extended its advance, suggesting some traders may be expecting an interest rate increase tomorrow even after inflation data came in slightly softer than economists’ expectations. Consumer prices climbed 5.1% in October from a year earlier, up from 4.9% but short of the 5.2% median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Most of the increase was due to gasoline prices, which surged to a record in last month.  The slump in crude since then will translate into a substantial decline in the price of gasoline, suggesting that pressure to tighten policy will ease. But the central bank looks past current data to expected future price pressures, and has repeatedly said it wants to see inflation closer to the midpoint of its 3% to 6% target range.
