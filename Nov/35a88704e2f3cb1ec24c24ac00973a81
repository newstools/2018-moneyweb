Mediclinic International reported a 8% decline in half-year core profit on Thursday reflecting a smaller contribution from Hirslanden, its Swiss operation. The private healthcare group reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of 213 million pounds ($277.24 million) for the six months to September 30, down from 232 million a year earlier.
