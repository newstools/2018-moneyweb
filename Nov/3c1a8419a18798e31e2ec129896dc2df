Walmart sailed into the holiday season with stronger-than-expected sales and a boosted full-year outlook, signaling that the world’s largest retailer can more than hold its own against rival Amazon.com in the critical holiday weeks ahead. Comparable sales for Walmart stores in the US — the best barometer of the company’s performance — rose 3.4% in the third quarter, beating analysts’ estimates. It now sees the measure growing at least 3% this year, better than the previous guidance of “about 3%.” As its food business goes, so goes Walmart. And it’s been going well lately thanks to price cuts, refurbished produce displays and a rapid rollout of curbside grocery pickup, now available at nearly 2 100 stores. Shoppers like the convenience, and the service has attracted new customers. Web sales came in ahead of Walmart’s full-year forecast, growing 43% in the US. It’s not the only retailer reporting Thursday: Investors will also hear from department-store chains J.C. Penney Co. and Nordstrom Inc. Walmart’s international division got some unwanted attention this week when Binny Bansal resigned from running its just-acquired Indian e-commerce unit Flipkart. India is a promising market for Walmart, particularly online as regulations limit its ability to operate traditional stores. But Amazon is also spending billions to reach the millions of smartphone-toting Indian consumers. Walmart shares swung between gains and losses in early trading. The shares rose as much as 1.4% as of 7:03 am in New York. The stock had risen 2.8% this year through Wednesday’s close, beating the 1% gain in the S&P 500 Index.
