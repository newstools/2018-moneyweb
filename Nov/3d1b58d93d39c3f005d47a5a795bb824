Telkom said on Thursday that it has reached a partnership with Netflix to offer the global streaming giant’s service on its LIT set-top box. “The partnership is Netflix’s first such agreement with a South African telecommunications company and a significant milestone as the company seeks to bring South African consumers the latest technologies and a great entertainment experience,” Telkom said in a statement. “As a start, we can respond to customer requests for the inclusion of Netflix on Telkom’s LIT TV box,” said content executive Wanda Mkhize said. Netflix will be available on the set-top box later this year. She said the teams are working on “exciting mobile and broadband service offerings to be launched before the end of the year. These will include enhanced LIT video options and data offerings.”  — (c) 2018 NewsCentral Media This article was originally published on TechCentral here.
