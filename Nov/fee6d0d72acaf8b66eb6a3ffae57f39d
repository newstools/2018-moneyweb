Here’s what caught our attention on Friday: 1. President fires Tom Moyane President Cyril Ramaphosa has taken a firm stance against suspended Sars Commissioner, Tom Moyane, announcing the termination of his contract with ‘immediate effect’. The Nugent Commission found that Moyane mismanaged Sars during his tenure as the commissioner and should be removed from office. 2. Gigaba’s days numbered The crackdown continues. The public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane has given the President 20 days to take disciplinary action against home affairs minister, Malusi Gigaba for lying under oath. The matter concerns a case relating to billionaire Oppenheimer family, in which Gigaba denied giving authorisation to the company to operate a private migration terminal at OR Tambo International Airport. Ramaphosa is said to be considering Mkhwebane’s directive. 3. Mr Tekkie launched There’s a new retailer around the corner. It’s called Mr Tekkie. The launch of Mr Tekkie comes after the founder of Tekkie Town, Braam van Huyssteen worked to reclaim the brand that was previously bought by Steinhoff and later unbundled to Steinhoff Africa Retail, which later imploded. The Mr Tekkie brand will be complementary to Tekkie Town and plans are to roll out 100 Mr Tekkie stores in two years. Read: Mr Tekkie’s very colourful launch 4. Mboweni remarks on closure of SAA Finance minister, Tito Mboweni said that state-owned South African Airways should be closed down. The airline has not generated an income since 2011 and is draining South Africa’s fiscus. Mboweni said it is unlikely that a private sector equity partner would come to its rescue and its issues are also unlikely to be sorted. Read: Mboweni says SAA should be closed down 5. Rand update The rand took a swing into slight negative this week, losing 1.09% to the dollar over the seven days. On Friday, the rand was at R14.30 to the dollar at 10:17am.
