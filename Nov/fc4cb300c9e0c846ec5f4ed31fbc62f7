Tencent Music Entertainment, the online-music arm of China’s largest social-media company, tentatively plans to start taking investor orders on December 4 for its planned US initial public offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The music-streaming firm aims to begin trading December 12 in New York, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Timing of the offering hasn’t been finalised and could change depending on market conditions, the people said. A deal from the Tencent unit would add to the $7.9 billion of first-time share sales from Chinese companies in the US this year, more than double the same period in 2017, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The year’s biggest China IPO in New York came from Netflix-style video streaming service iQiyi, which raised $2.4 billion in March, the data show. Tencent Music declined to comment in an emailed statement. The company listed its IPO size as $1 billion in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in early October. The amount is a placeholder and may change. Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are arranging the share sale.
