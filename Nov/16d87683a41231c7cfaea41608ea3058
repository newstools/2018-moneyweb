South African media and e-commerce giant Naspers reported a 39% jump in half-year profit on Friday, thanks to a strong performance in its investment in China’s Tencent. Naspers, which owns about a third of Tencent, said core headline earnings came in at $1.7 billion, or 385 cents per share, in the six months ended September compared with $1.2 billion, or 277 cents per share, a year earlier. Core headline EPS is Naspers’ main profit measure that strips out non-operational and one-off items. Tencent’s contribution to core headline EPS of $1.8 billion helped offset weakness at the company’s other businesses that include e-commerce platforms MakeMyTrip and Delivery Hero. Founded more than 100 years ago in Stellenbosch, South Africa, Naspers has transformed itself from a newspaper publisher into a $87 billion empire but it owes all of that valuation to its one-third stake in Tencent. The stake has become not just a moneyspinner for the group but also a headache as it dwarfs Naspers’ own market capitalisation by 40%. Share in Naspers rose 1.1% to R2 280 rand as of 13:48 GMT.
