Discovery Health Medical Scheme, the country’s largest with 2.8 million lives under administration, has published the contributions members will pay from January 2019. The weighted price increase is reportedly 9.2%. Last year, the weighted increase was 7.9%. The sharpest increases are at the high end, with contributions on its Executive Plan and Classic plans increasing by double digits (10%). It is worth mentioning that contributions for children are up by the most, percentage-wise, on a number of plans (That said, a maximum of three children are counted).  2018 2019 Change  Main Adult Child Main Adult Child Main Adult Child Executive Plan R5950 R5950 R1134 R6541 R6541 R1248 9,93% 9,93% 10,05% Classic Comprehensive R4882 R4618 R974 R5368 R5077 R1070 9,95% 9,94% 9,86% Classic Delta Comprehensive R4398 R4162 R874 R4834 R4577 R962 9,91% 9,97% 10,07% Classic Comprehensive Zero MSA* R3662 R3464 R731 R4026 R3808 R803 9,94% 9,93% 9,85% Essential Comprehensive R4102 R3881 R825 R4509 R4265 R908 9,92% 9,89% 10,06% Essential Delta Comprehensive R3694 R3490 R742 R4062 R3837 R815 9,96% 9,94% 9,84% Classic Priority R3214 R2534 R1286 R3501 R2761 R1401 8,93% 8,96% 8,94% Essential Priority R2763 R2172 R1103 R3010 R2365 R1202 8,94% 8,89% 8,98% Classic Saver R2773 R2186 R1110 R3021 R2382 R1209 8,94% 8,97% 8,92% Classic Delta Saver R2214 R1749 R890 R2412 R1906 R969 8,94% 8,98% 8,88% Essential Saver R2203 R1652 R883 R2400 R1800 R962 8,94% 8,96% 8,95% Essential Delta Saver R1758 R1325 R705 R1915 R1444 R768 8,93% 8,98% 8,94% Coastal Saver R2160 R1621 R870 R2373 R1783 R958 9,86% 9,99% 10,11% Classic Smart* R1647 R1298 R658 R1794 R1415 R717 8,93% 9,01% 8,97% Essential Smart* R1180 R1180 R1180 R1285 R1285 R1285 8,90% 8,90% 8,90% Classic Core* R2064 R1626 R826 R2248 R1772 R900 8,91% 8,98% 8,96% Classic Delta Core* R1652 R1301 R660 R1799 R1418 R720 8,90% 8,99% 9,09% Essential Core* R1773 R1329 R712 R1931 R1448 R776 8,91% 8,95% 8,99% Essential Delta Core* R1417 R1065 R569 R1543 R1161 R620 8,89% 9,01% 8,96% Coastal Core* R1610 R1209 R641 R1770 R1330 R704 9,94% 10,01% 9,83% The full Discovery Health Medical Scheme 2019 Health Plan Guide is available here. In its plans for lower-income earners (who are means-tested), KeyCare, income bands have been consolidated.

Vitality Active, aimed at younger people who may not yet be on medical aid, sees a simple R5 per month increase. Medical aid members – Discovery or not – would do well to review the plans they are on as well as their scheme versus others together with their broker or financial advisor to ensure they are on appropriate cover. Very often, one’s circumstances when taking out cover in the first place will have changed completely after a number of years. Additionally, new plans introduced since may be far more appropriate, and may very well be cheaper. * Hilton Tarrant works at YFM. He can still be contacted at hilton@moneyweb.co.za.
