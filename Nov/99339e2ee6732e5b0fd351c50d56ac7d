BMW said it expects a difficult end to the year after trade tensions, higher provisions and pricing pressure during the third quarter nearly halved automotive profits Key insights Unlike the fourth-quarter recovery forecast by Volkswagen and Daimler, BMW said the drag will continue to “have a significant effect” on results during the period. Manufacturers are “increasingly confronted with adverse external factors, the negative impact of which cannot be fully offset,” said chief financial officer Nicolas Peter. Returns from automaking nearly halved to 4.4% of sales during the third quarter. BMW is dealing with challenges on multiple fronts. New emissions tests in Europe that took effect in September led competitors to flood the market, undermining prices. The tough environment was a key reason for BMW to lower profit targets in September. Recalls to fix fire-prone vehicles and other warranty claims forced BMW to set aside more funds. A global campaign to exchange certain engine modules contributed to a boost in provisions by 679 million euros ($777 million). Market reaction BMW fell 2.2% in early trading on Frankfurt’s Tradegate. Carmaker shares have buckled this year. BMW has declined 11% while Daimler has lost more than a quarter of its value. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
