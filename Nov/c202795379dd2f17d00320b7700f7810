Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s 94-year-old former president, is no longer able to walk, his successor said Saturday. Mugabe has been receiving treatment in a Singapore hospital for the past two months, President Emmerson Mnangagwa told ruling party supporters in Murombedzi, 110 kilometres (68 miles) west of the capital, Harare. Mugabe had been due to return October 15, but is now expected back next week. “We have just received a message that he is much better now and will return on November 30. He can no longer walk, but we continue to take care of him,” Mnangagwa said. Mugabe was pushed out of power in an army-backed operation in November 2017 after ruling for 37 years and replaced by Mnangagwa. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
