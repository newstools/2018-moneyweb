Apple’s disappointing earnings report has put the iPhone maker’s $1 trillion market value at risk. A revenue forecast that fell short of the average analyst estimate at the midpoint and weaker-than-expected iPhone sales sent the stock tumbling in extended trading. Apple’s disclosure that it will stop reporting unit sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs extended the decline, sending the shares down as much as 7.7%.  Apple, which topped the $1 trillion mark on August 2, had a market value of $1.073 trillion at the close of trading on Thursday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Based on that value, a 7% decline would equate to about $75 billion lost. The number of outstanding shares used to calculate that market value will probably be lower. The Cupertino, California-based company bought back 92.5 million shares during the quarter for about $19.4 billion, chief financial officer Luca Maestri said on the earnings call. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
