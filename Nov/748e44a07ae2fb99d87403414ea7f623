The majority shareholders of German car-parts maker Continental have lost about $16 billion — more than half of their combined wealth — so far this year. Continental chairman Georg Schaeffler and his mother Maria-Elisabeth Schaeffler-Thumann, the vice chairman, saw their fortunes tumble 53% after the company warned that extra costs and tough business conditions in Europe and Asia would weigh on profits. A senior executive said this week that the challenges will persist into 2019. They’re now worth a combined $14.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, after the biggest wealth drop this year among Europe’s richest families. The mother and son also control Schaeffler AG, a publicly traded German engineering group that has faced similar pressures as Continental, the world’s second-largest car-parts maker. Shares of both companies have plunged more than 40% this year. Georg Schaeffler, 54, inherited 80% of the ball-bearing business that carries his surname when his father died in 1996, while his mother inherited the rest, and then orchestrated one of Germany’s largest hostile takeovers by acquiring Continental a decade ago for more than $17 billion. He’s now the world’s 113th-richest person, according to the Bloomberg index. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
