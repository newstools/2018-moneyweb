Fresh anxieties about tech stocks dented European stocks as a drop in Apple shares on Wall Street, after a report the consumer tech giant is cutting production for its new iPhones, sapped appetite for the sector globally. The tech sector sank as much as 1.7%, hitting its lowest level since February 28 2017 as stocks supplying chips to Apple suffered. Apple suppliers were among the worst-performing. STMicroelectronics shares tumbled 3%, Infineon fell 3%, and AMS lost 3%. Tech has lost its crown as best-performing sector in Europe and is now down 8% this year, behind sectors including oil, healthcare, media, and utilities. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.4% by 08:25 GMT, with Germany’s DAX down 0.7% and Britain’s FTSE 100 down 0.2%. Shares in French carmaker Renault remained under pressure after its 8.4% drop on Monday when CEO Carlos Ghosn was arrested. Downgrades from Exane and BAML analysts weighed the stock down 1.3%. Outside tech, results drove the biggest moves. German payments firm Wirecard’s shares fell 4.5% to the bottom of the DAX after the company said it expected core earnings between 740 and 800 million euros, implying profits growth of 37.5% – at the midpoint of the range. British electrical components maker Halma rose 2.7%, among top STOXX 600 gainers after the company reported a 19% jump in pretax profit for the six months ended September 30. It also warned Brexit could cause supply chain disruptions. Peer Spectris topped the STOXX with a 7.3 percent gain after the company stuck to its full-year outlook. British challenger bank CYBG, however, sank 8 percent to the bottom of the European index as profits disappointed.
