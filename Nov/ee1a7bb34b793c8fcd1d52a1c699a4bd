South African energy and chemicals company Sasol said it expected to report strong first-half earnings, boosted by higher oil prices and a weaker rand. Earnings per share before one-time items in the six months through December will jump 12% to 29%, Johannesburg-based Sasol said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our underlying cash flow performance and earnings are expected to be much stronger than the period ended December 31 2017,” it said, adding that a “satisfactory performance of its global assets” also lifted earnings. A detailed report will be released on January 24.
