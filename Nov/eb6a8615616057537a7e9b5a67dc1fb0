Steinhoffâ€™s commercial director Louis du Preez will take over as the new permanent Chief Executive Officer after acting CEO Danie van der Merwe steps down on December 31, the firm said on Monday. The company, which revealed multi-billion dollar holes in its balance sheet almost a year ago, said du Preez, has been jointly leading the restructuring of the group since joining the management board in December.
