South Africa’s central bank increased its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to 6.75% on Thursday in a close decision, saying the longer-term inflation outlook remained elevated and that it could not risk waiting until later to act. In a poll taken by Reuters last week, 16 of 26 economists said the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) would keep its repo rate at 6.50% while the rest opted for a 25 basis-point hike. Three of the six Monetary Policy Committee members wanted a 25 basis points increase while the other three called for no change, Governor Lesetja Kganyago told reporters in Pretoria. “We then closed the room, debated vigorously until a decision was made. In the end, the decision was that we go with the 25 basis points hike,” Kganyago said. “Delaying the adjustment could cause inflation expectations to become entrenched at higher levels and that contributes to second round effects that would require an even stronger monetary policy response,” Kganyago said. Dr Andrew Golding of Pam Golding Properties says that while it was a tough call for the MPC, the decision is disappointing at this point in the year. “A pause in the repo rate cycle would have helped stimulate economic confidence and provided some relief to consumers.” The real estate sector is definitely not immune to these effects, says Mike Greeff, CEO of Christies Real Estate. He says the lower and middle sectors are likely to be impacted most. “Lending institutions will in all likelihood implement more stringent lending measures, which would most likely have a dampening effect on new bond applications from first-time buyers.” The rand was buoyed by the decision, firming by more than 1.3% to the dollar, its strongest level since August 10. It later traded at 1.01% firmer at 13.77. <a href="http://iono.fm/e/628635">Content hosted by iono.fm</a>
