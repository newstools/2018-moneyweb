Gigaba said Tuesday that he was stepping aside from his post in the Department of Home Affairs for the sake of the country and the party to which he belongs. In commenting on Gigaba’s resignation as MP, ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu said: “We appreciate the fact that comrade Gigaba has put the interests of the ANC and that of the country first, which has informed his line of action. This is what we expect from any cadre of our glorious movement, of which comrade Gigaba has remained true to.” Read: Ex-finance minister resigns from cabinet In recent months, Gigaba came under fire after the Public Protector found that he lied under oath and following the circulation of a private sex video.
