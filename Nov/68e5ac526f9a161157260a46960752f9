There would probably be several contenders for the title of ‘the biggest corporate crime in South Africa’, but if one was forced to choose, there is no doubt that Steinhoff would be among the top contenders for the title. This week’s Financial Mail carries an explosive story on Steinhoff, its history and the people who built what now looks like a global house of cards. The article, headed “Steinhoff’s secret history – How Markus Jooste’s scam began”, was written by amaBhungane journalist Craig McKune and the Financial Mail’s Warren Thompson (a former Moneyweb journalist). In the article, they detail the events that they consider to be the start of the biggest corporate crime in South African history. The National Press Club is hosting a media briefing at 2pm today (Friday, 2nd October) where Thompson will explain the complex web of companies and deals they have uncovered. He will take questions.
