South African financial services group Investec reported a 14.2% rise in half-year profit on Thursday buoyed by its banking unit. Operating profit for the six months to September 30 rose to 359.3 million pounds ($467.6 million) from 314.6 million a year earlier. Investec’s banking unit, which focuses on high net worth individuals, reported an 18% in operating profit to 245.4 million pounds while its asset management arm delivered a 10% rise to 91.5 million pounds. The company is hiving off and separately listing its asset management operations in London to cut costs and better compete in a industry where fees are falling and costs are rising. The break-up is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019, Investec said in the results filing.
