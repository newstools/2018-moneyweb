Shares in MTN Group surged 4% on Friday with traders attributing the rise to news that Nigeria’s central bank was on the verge of reaching an agreement over a $8.1 billon dispute with the South African telecoms group. The stock rose as much as 4.1% before trimming gains to trade 2.14% higher at R87.6 as of 09:00 GMT. “Looks like there’s something that going to be finalised in Nigeria and the share price is reflecting that,” said Ryan Woods of Independent Securities. A second trader said the disputed amount could be reduced.
