Sibanye Gold said it obtained a court interdict against the National Union of Mineworkers and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union to stop the violence that has erupted during a strike at the company’s operations in South Africa. Night shifts remain suspended to ensure the safety of employees, the mining company said in an emailed statement on Thursday. One miner has been killed and several injured at Sibanye’s operations after Amcu started a strike over wages. Operations at the Driefontein, Kloof and Beatrix gold mines were suspended on Wednesday after violence broke out. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
