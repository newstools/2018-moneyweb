South Africa’s high-speed rail network is seeking R4 billion to increase its number of trains by 50% ahead of a potential expansion to other parts of Johannesburg and Pretoria. The Development Bank of Southern Africa is leading the fundraising, a spokeswoman said in an emailed response to questions on Wednesday. Canada’s Bombardier, CRRC Corp of China and local firm Egoli Rail are among the bidders to supply the trains, she said. The government-owned Gautrain is also planning to build a second depot. The purchases will come ahead of a wider expansion that could see the Gautrain add a further 150 kilometers of track to its 80-kilometre network. The service, which was built ahead of the 2010 soccer world cup in South Africa, currently runs from Pretoria to central Johannesburg and would extend as far as Soweto in the southwest under the proposals, which the National Treasury is considering. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
