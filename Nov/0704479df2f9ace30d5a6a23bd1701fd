Pandora A/S cut its outlook again and said its search for a new chief executive officer continues. The Copenhagen-based jewelry maker said it now needs to “materially’ cut costs as management pledges it will try to “re-set” the business through 2019. Third-quarter net income came in at 951 million kroner ($145 million), missing the average analyst estimate of 1.08 billion kroner. Chief Financial Officer Anders Boyer described the results as “ unsatisfactory,” in the statement. “We have reviewed our business and decided to launch a forceful program with the aim to materially reduce costs across the company to free up resources to invest in sustainable like-for-like growth,” he said. Per Hansen, an investment economist at Nordnet in Copenhagen, described the results as “terrible.” For investors and analysts, Hansen said “it’s hard to know which numbers to put in their models.” Pandora cut its full-year outlook and now sees revenue growth in constant currencies of 2% to 4%, compared with 4% to 7% previously; it also abandoned its long-term revenue goal and said it is reviewing its ebitda margin target. That follows a decision to slash the outlook in August, which led to the dismissal of CEO Anders Colding Friis. CFO Boyer and Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Schwartz have jointly taken on the work of the CEO until a permanent replacement for Friis is found. In Tuesday’s statement, Pandora said its search for a new CEO continues Pandora shares have lost more than 40% this year, putting the company on track for its worst annual performance since 2011. Tuesday’s trading is due to start at 9 a.m. local time in Copenhagen.
