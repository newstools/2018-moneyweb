Remember 2009? For Alibaba Group Holding, that was the year co-founder Jack Ma created China’s first retail extravaganza around the holiday of Singles’ Day. The holiday originally didn’t have much to do with shopping. It had started in the 1990s on university campuses as a celebration of being single, a retort of sorts to Valentine’s Day. But Ma parlayed that into the world’s biggest shopping day by encouraging consumers to treat themselves to heavily discounted sneakers, mattresses and Gucci bags. Like digital doorbusters on Black Friday, China’s consumers flood the company’s websites at midnight to get the best deals. Alibaba amplifies the attention with 24 hours of festivities that rotate each year through different cities in China. Pharell Williams and Nicole Kidman joined in 2017. Alibaba has said that it wants to take the show aboard at some point. Here is a history of Singles’ Day through the years.
