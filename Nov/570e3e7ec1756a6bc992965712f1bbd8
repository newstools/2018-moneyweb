South African Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan on Monday laid charges of criminal defamation, crimen injuria and incitement of violence against Julius Malema, the leader of the populist Economic Freedom Fighters party. Malema last week accused Gordhan of being corrupt, labelled him “a dog of white monopoly capital,” and said he had abused his position to further his daughter’s business interests. “It’s time to stand up,” Gordhan told reporters after filing the lawsuit at a police station in Pretoria, the capital. “It’s time that justice takes its course.”
