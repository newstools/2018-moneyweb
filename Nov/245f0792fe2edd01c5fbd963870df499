The German economy shrank for the first time since early 2015 after the auto industry took a hit. The 0.2% contraction in the third quarter was worse than expected and the biggest in more than five years. While the hope is that the setback is related largely to new emissions tests that temporarily disrupted car production, the data are likely to feed into fears that the euro-area’s expansion is running into trouble.  The statistics office doesn’t give a detailed breakdown in this reading and didn’t mention the car industry, saying exports and private consumption both dropped, but equipment investment and construction rose. What our economists say… “The good news is that the economy will expand at a decent clip so long as auto output doesn’t take another leg down — and that’s highly unlikely. We expect a material rebound as industrial production picks up a bit further through the quarter.”–Jamie Murray, Bloomberg Economics. The third-quarter weakness in Germany dragged on the euro area, with data later on Wednesday forecast to show its economy expanded at the weakest pace since 2014. While the ECB has already downplayed the loss of momentum, a year-end revival isn’t assured. Germany’s manufacturing sector — which accounts for almost a quarter of economic output — may feel the pain of trade tensions and China’s slowdown. Closer to home, Italy is mired in a budget battle with its European Union partners, and its growth stalled in the third quarter for the first time in almost four years. Any signs of a persistent weakness in Germany, which accounts for a third of the euro area economy, would play into the thinking among ECB policy makers as they complete the exit from three years of large-scale bond-buying. But chief economist Peter Praet said Tuesday while there’s been a slowdown in the euro area, domestic demand remains “robust.” © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
