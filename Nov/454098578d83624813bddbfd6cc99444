<a href="https://iono.fm/e/630446">Content hosted by iono.fm</a> When one drills into why this is the case, it becomes clear that beating the passives is actually doable. So why is it that active managers have disappointed? Why has the transition from actives to passives been so dramatic over the last few years? What are the learnings? What are the benefits of passive management versus active management? Is it not possible to combine the best of both worlds? Is there a strategy with which one can beat the passives consistently going forward? In this upcoming webinar, Bastian Teichgreeber from Prescient Investment Management will answer these and other questions. He will also discuss the strategy that Prescient has adopted to achieve the desired investment outcome. More on the guest:
