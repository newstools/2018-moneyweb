South Africa’s cash strapped state-run power utility Eskom will appoint a permanent chief executive by the end of April to begin the process of reforming the ailing utility, which may include reducing job numbers, its chairman said on Monday. “We will be appointing a new chief executive by the end of April and hopefully weeks thereafter we will appoint a new CFO,” newly appointed chairman Jabu Mabuza told a labour union conference.
