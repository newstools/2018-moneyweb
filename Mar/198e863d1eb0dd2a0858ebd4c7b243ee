Tiger Brands has not calculated the potential financial impact of class action suits following the outbreak of listeria at its factories which has resulted in 180 deaths since January 2017, its chief financial officer said on Monday. “At this stage doing the calculations hasn’t been something that has preoccupied management,” Noel Doyle told Radio 702, adding that Tiger Brands was working “flat out” to find the source of the outbreak. Tiger Brands said earlier it has received notice of two class action suits against it, with the total amount claimed estimated at R425 million.
