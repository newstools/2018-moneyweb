Boyce Lloyd, CEO of the 100-year-old KWV, feels his duty acutely. Not only is he painfully conscious of the hundred years of leadership that have preceded his own, and the precious South African heritage asset that has been placed in his hands, but he is also aware of his responsibility to the employees of this company. The overarching belief – which is where his sense of responsibility originates – is that all CEOs are duty-bound to leave their companies in a better state than they found them. This theme of the company revolving around its people (as opposed to the more common opposite that one is accustomed to) runs true and straight through every action that Lloyd takes and every business principle that he espouses. He is a leader who is intimately involved with the roles that employees play in his company, and how those roles impact on their lives, and their sense of meaning and purpose. In this Quick Insight, extracted from a full-length interview, Lloyd’s character is keenly revealed as he elaborates on his beliefs and the lessons that they can teach other business leaders.

The interview draws on the person’s life, failures and the lessons they have learnt on their journey to the successful leadership positions they hold today.
