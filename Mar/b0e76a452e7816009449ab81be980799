Here’s what caught our attention on Tuesday: 1. Numsa sets interdict against renewable energy projects The National Union of Mineworkers (Numsa) is against government and Eskom signing a deal that will supply the country with renewable energy, arguing that it’s not favourable to the working class, because [coal-fired power plant] jobs will be lost. Additionally it stated that electricity from renewables will cost more than coal-fired electricity, Moneyweb reported. Minister of energy and mineral resources Jeff Radebe said last week that an agreement was settled in which Eskom and government would sign a purchase agreement with independent power producer projects (IPP) on Tuesday. 2.
