The world’s second-biggest proxy advisor recommended that Tesla shareholders turn down a plan to grant Elon Musk a $2.6 billion award, sapping the company’s effort to assure investors that the co-founder isn’t leaving anytime soon. The award, which could give Chief Executive Officer Musk an additional 12% of the company’s shares, is too costly and will dilute other investors, Glass Lewis & Co. said Monday in a report to clients. Tesla needs majority shareholder approval to make the grant. Supporters have praised the compensation plan as a signal that Musk will remain at Tesla and that his other ambitions won’t take priority over stock returns. To some, the 10-figure package has raised questions about whether it’s really aimed at motivating Musk, who’s already a billionaire, or a very expensive way of calming investors concerned that he’ll abandon the maker of electric cars for one of his other ventures. A Tesla representative didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
