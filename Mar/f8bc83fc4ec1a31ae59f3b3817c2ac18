South Africa’s rand gave up its previous session’s gains in early trade on Tuesday, as the market positioned itself for the central bank’s interest rate decision on Wednesday. At 07:06 GMT, the rand traded at 11.64 per dollar, 0.17% lower than its overnight close of 11.6200 in New York. South Africa’s Reserve Bank (Sarb) is expected to cut its repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50%, according to a Reuters poll of 22 economist, as the central bank aims to boost the economy towards growth and employment creation. “Should the rand strengthen notably further this year, and the new levels look to be maintained, the Sarb may consider an interest rate cut from Q2 18 on consequent expected lower inflation for 2019, and in 2020 as well,” Investec economist Annabel Bishop said in a note. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 0.5 basis point at 7.910%. The Johannesburg All-share index was up 1.15% to 56,821 points, while the Top-40 index climbed 1.15% to 50,135 points.
