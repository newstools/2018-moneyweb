South Africa’s rand steadied against the dollar early on Tuesday as investors awaited current account and consumer price inflation data due later in the day, as well as a Moody’s ratings review on Friday. At 0610 GMT, the rand traded at 12.02 per dollar, not far off its overnight close of 12.02. The central bank will publish current account data for the last quarter of 2017 at 0800 GMT, while the statistics office will release February CPI numbers at the same time. Moody’s rating decision expected on Friday and a widely anticipated hike in US interest rates on Wednesday have also kept a lid on demand for the rand. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was down 2 basis points at 8.16%.
