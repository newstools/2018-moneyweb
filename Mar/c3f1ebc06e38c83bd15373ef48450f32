Tencent Holdings Ltd. investors will likely be celebrating tomorrow, if history is a guide. The Chinese tech giant will announce its fourth-quarter earnings after Hong Kong’s equity market closes on Wednesday, an event that typically provokes an outsized rally. The stock climbed an average 1.8% on the day after the company’s quarterly releases in the past five years, compared with a gain of just 0.1% for the Hang Seng Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts are already getting ahead of a post-earnings bounce: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Monday hiked its 12-month price target on Tencent by 22%, while Morgan Stanley boosted it by 10%. Tencent is projected to report 56% revenue growth for the fourth quarter. Given the company’s track record as one of the world’s best performing in the past decade, bears are hard to find. Still, with a market value of $574 billion, and the biggest weighting on MSCI’s Asian benchmark, any misstep could be costly. The options market is implying a post-earnings move of 3.8% either way, which would make it the biggest earnings-day reaction since a 7.1% rally in August 2015.  The stock climbed 1.5% at 1:33 p.m. in Hong Kong. © 2018 Bloomberg
