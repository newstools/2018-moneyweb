PSG Group chairman Jannie Mouton, chief executive Piet Mouton, and non-executive director Jan Mouton have, through various vehicles, bought over R60 million worth of shares in the company over the past month. These purchases on the open market come on the back of a bout of weakness in PSG Group’s share price, following the publication of Viceroy Research’s reports on the group’s single largest holding, Capitec (it owns 30.7% of the bank). Capitec slumped sharply on the day of the report’s release (January 30), and while there was some recovery thereafter, shares have been trading in the R800-R850 range since. Over 30 days, the bank’s shares are down 20%. PSG Group is also down, and has been trading in the R210-R220 range since the Viceroy report was published. Shares are down 16% over 30 days, after having traded above the R250-mark since October. In December, PSG almost closed above R300. The purchases by companies and trusts, of which the Moutons are either trustees or beneficiaries (or both), seem to be opportunistic given the recent weakness. Prior to January and February, a number of far smaller purchases were made for what seems to be trusts for other family members and children.

Historically, there have been numerous situations where the shares trade at a premium. As recently as the end of the 2016/17 financial year (February 28 2017), the shares traded at R251.43 versus a SOTP of R240.87, a 4% premium. As at March 1 (intraday), the discount to the sum-of-the-parts as per the group’s excellent online calculation is 15.3% (R257.88 versus a share price of R218.50). These recent purchases remain small in the context of the directors’ holdings (they own 30.2% of the group). As at the end of February 2017, Jannie (JF) Mouton owned 51.3 million shares, or 23.6% of PSG, primarily via trusts and other vehicles. In October, he distributed 10.278 million PSG shares, then worth R1.568 billion, to the Jannie Mouton Foundation. His philanthropic endeavours are channelled through this foundation, which focuses on education, training and skills development. Following this, his shareholding in the group reduced to 17.7%. PSG entered a closed period yesterday during which no directors are able to trade shares until the publication of results on April 19. Capitec’s directors have also been buying, but the numbers are more modest. CEO Gerrie Fourie made a R1.5 million on-market purchase on January 31 2018 (at an average price of R808.49). Given the release of the Viceroy report the day prior, this would’ve been a symbolic move especially since non-executive director Chris Otto, who serves on the PSG Group and Capitec Bank boards, bought R4.98 million worth of shares, via an associate, on February 1 (at an average price of R840.04). Between October and December, Capitec directors sold over R200 million worth of shares. Capitec also entered into a closed period yesterday. Its results are due on March 28.
