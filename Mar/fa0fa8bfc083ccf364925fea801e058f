Trump’s trade war was bad, though not fatal. For Chinese stocks, Tuesday’s technology tumble poses a graver threat. Just three tech companies — Tencent, Alibaba and Sunny Optical — account for half of the MSCI China Index’s 4.6% gain this year through Tuesday, and all three derive the vast bulk of their revenues domestically. For members of MSCI’s Chinese benchmark as a whole, the US accounts for just 5% of sales, according to Citigroup. Where the gauge is vulnerable is its reliance on tech companies to propel gains. Almost by themselves, Tencent  Alibaba, Baidu and Sunny Optical Technology have helped drive the measure up 70% in the past two years, more than double the return of the S&P 500. Like the US, valuations are looking stretched. Their outsized impact was in full display on Wednesday. Tencent tumbled 3.5%, while Sunny Optical sank 9.1% in its steepest loss this year, helping drag the MSCI China down 1.9%. The NYSE FANG+ index, tracking the FANG block and its megacap brethren, tumbled 5.6% on Tuesday in the biggest rout in data going back to September 2014. © 2018 Bloomberg
