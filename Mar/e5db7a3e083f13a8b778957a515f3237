It’s a rating decision that could trigger as much as $6 billion of capital outflows from Africa’s most industrialized economy. Investors aren’t batting an eyelid. South Africa will probably escape a junk assessment from Moody’s Investors Service on Friday, according to 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. A downgrade of the country’s local-currency debt would see the nation’s securities exit CitiGroup’s World Government Bond Index, leading to forced selling of government notes by funds that track the gauge. Traders don’t see much prospect of that, options pricing shows. While the rand’s one-week implied volatility versus the dollar has edged up in recent days, it’s still well below the long-term average. The currency gained 0.2% to 11.82 per dollar by 9:02 am in Johannesburg, bringing its advance since Moody’s placed South Africa on credit-watch negative in November to 20%.  Here’s what investors and analysts are saying about market reaction to the rating review.
