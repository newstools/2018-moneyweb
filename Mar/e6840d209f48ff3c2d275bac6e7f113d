The South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) cut its benchmark lending rate to a two-year low as it sees inflation staying in target until at least the end of 2020. The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to cut the repurchase rate by 25 basis points to 6.5%, Governor Lesetja Kganyago told reporters Wednesday in the capital, Pretoria. The second rate cut since July comes as inflation slowed to a three-year low in February, moving well below the midpoint of the central bank’s target range of 3% to 6%, and 2017 economic growth exceeded forecasts. It could add to the positive sentiment that gained momentum when Cyril Ramaphosa succeeded Jacob Zuma as president last month, boosting business and consumer confidence and the currency. “The outlook for the domestic economy has improved in recent months,” Johannes Khosa, an economist at Nedbank Ltd. in Johannesburg, said before the announcement. “Chances of further cuts for the rest of the year will be limited by increasing inflation as the year progresses and improving domestic demand.” South Africa escaped a third junk credit rating last week when Moody’s Investors Service kept its assessment of the nation’s debt unchanged and changed the outlook to stable from negative, citing recent changes in political leadership. The reduction was in line with all but four of the estimates by 16 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Four MPC members voted for a cut and three favoured unchanged policy, Kganyago said. After more than three years with an even number, the panel now consists of seven people following the appointment of Fundi Tshazibana last month. The central bank forecasts inflation will remain in the target band until at least the end of 2020, peaking at 5.5% in the first quarter of next year. © 2018 Bloomberg Source: Bloomberg
