South Africa will not allow illegal land grabs, new President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday, after lawmakers backed plans for land expropriation without compensation last month. “We cannot have a situation where we allow land grabs, because that is anarchy,” Ramaphosa said in a speech in parliament. “We cannot have a situation of anarchy when we have proper constitutional means through which we can work to give land to our people.”
