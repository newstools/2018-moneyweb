You can now tip your Uber driver directly from the app in South Africa. The Internet ride-hailing company announced on Tuesday that it has introduced the tipping feature with immediate effect. At the end of each trip, Uber and Uber Eats users will be given the option of various tip values, or they can customise an amount for the driver. “Over the years, we’ve heard a lot of drivers asking us to roll out an in-app tipping function, so their clients can more easily reward great service and the act of going above and beyond what’s expected,” said Uber sub-Saharan Africa GM Alon Lits in a statement. “Improving the driving experience has been a key priority for us over the last year. We’re excited to roll out this new feature as a continuation of this effort and make the app work best for over 13 000 drivers in South Africa.” Uber drivers must opt in before being able to accept tips from clients. The tipping options will be made available below the rating and compliments section and will remain “completely optional”, Uber said. “Payments will be deducted from the rider’s registered credit card or cash-paying customers are free to tip an additional amount of their choice.” Passengers wanting to make use of in-app tipping must make sure they have downloaded the latest version of the Uber app. Tips go directly to drivers and couriers — Uber receives no service fees.  — (c) 2018 NewsCentral Media This article was originally published on TechCentral here.
