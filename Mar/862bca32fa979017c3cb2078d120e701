As the Nasdaq endures its longest string of daily losses since November 2016, and with other stock indexes also under pressure, there is a notable sense of unease among investors who believed until recently that selloffs were very limited in duration, of small magnitude, and quickly reversible. Now, markets suddenly seem less confident about their ability to shrug off political factors. They also appear more vulnerable to contagion from company-specific news such as Facebook’s apparent entanglement in questionable political-messaging practices. There are also significant realignments that result in these ten issues: As long as global growth continues to rise in a sustainable and more inclusive fashion, sounder fundamentals would help anchor the long-awaited market transition away from liquidity support and toward stronger economic and corporate underpinnings. And while this would carry the hope of a sounder medium-term footing for markets, it does not imply a return to the abnormally low volatility of last year. The two-way price volatility of recent weeks, which was in sharp contrast to the relatively long period of calm that preceded it, is a better indication of what lies ahead. Fortunately, there are observable market-based variables that can be monitored on a high-frequency basis to shed light on the probability of success.
