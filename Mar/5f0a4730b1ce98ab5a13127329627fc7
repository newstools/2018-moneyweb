Naspers’ selldown is prolonging its dependence on Tencent . The South African group is offloading shares worth up to $10.6 billion in the Chinese gaming giant. But it’s keeping the remaining 31% for at least three years, and will invest rather than distribute the proceeds. Read: Naspers to sell 2% of its stake in Tencent Back in 2001, the Johannesburg-based group invested $33 million in what has become China’s most valuable company by market capitalisation. That stake is now worth an extraordinary $176 billion. Yet even as Tencent’s value has soared in recent years, Naspers’ core print and video businesses have struggled. Boss Bob van Dijk’s other tech bets have also yet to deliver. The result is that Naspers trades at a huge discount to the value of its Tencent shareholding. Last year, an activist investor published an open letter urging the company to consider spinning off its Tencent stake, among other things. At the time Naspers ruled out any sale or unbundling. The decision to cut its stake by just 2 percentage points is therefore a huge disappointment for shareholders. Though the sale trims the valuation discount slightly to roughly $46 billion, according to Breakingviews calculations, Naspers has also pledged not to reduce its stake any further for at least three years. And investors will not get any direct benefits. Instead, Naspers says it will reinvest the proceeds in areas like classifieds, online food delivery and fintech. Naspers has created massive value from backing Tencent. But as long as the group sees its investment as a source of cash, rather than an asset whose value should be maximised, shareholders have little reason to give the company any more credit for its bet.
