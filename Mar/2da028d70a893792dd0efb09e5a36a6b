The rand steadied on Monday, holding on to gains notched up in the previous session as a benign US jobs report eased worries about inflation and faster rate hikes. At 1526 GMT, the rand traded at 11.817 per dollar, not far off its New York close of 11.820 on Friday. The currency has largely stayed at elevated levels this year, buoyed by expectations of faster economic growth under South Africa’s new political leadership. “The rand has continued to benefit from favourable sentiment in the overall emerging market sphere, but remains vulnerable to shifts in expectations regarding the pace of US monetary policy tightening,” NKC African Economics said in a note.
