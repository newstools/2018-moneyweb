It’s been an expensive two months for the 500 wealthiest people on the planet. Their combined net worth fell $181 billion this week as the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered their steepest weekly drop in more than two years amid heated rhetoric over tariffs and retaliation. The group’s wealth has shrunk $436 billion since markets peaked on Jan. 26. Mark Zuckerberg bore the brunt this week with $10.3 billion wiped from his fortune on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He dropped three places to seventh on the ranking as scandal unfolded at Facebook. The social network’s shares tumbled 14% following reports that it let Cambridge Analytica amass data on 50 million users.  The downdraft also caught Larry Ellison, down $7 billion as Oracle forecast slowing sales growth for cloud-related products. Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos and Alphabet’s Larry Page lost $17 billion combined. The world’s 500 biggest fortunes now encompass $5.2 trillion, according to the index. © 2018 Bloomberg
