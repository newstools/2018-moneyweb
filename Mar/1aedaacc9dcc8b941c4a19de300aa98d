US stocks tumbled, sending the S&P 500 Index to its biggest weekly loss in more than two years, on concern that a trade war and higher borrowing rates could throttle global growth. Oil surged on speculation sanctions on Iran will be re-imposed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped to the lowest since November, led by losses Friday in companies as diverse as 3M to Goldman Sachs Group. The S&P 500 dropped to its least since the volatility-fuelled meltdown in early February. Gold rallied and Treasury yields declined as investors sought safe havens.  Global markets were caught in a risk-off mode after China announced retaliation against President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs announced Thursday. China’s ambassador to the US wouldn’t rule out the possibility of the Asian nation scaling back purchases of Treasuries in response to the tariffs. It’s been a miserable week for higher-risk markets globally, as a trade war edged closer, the tech sector was roiled by Facebook’s privacy scandal and data showed European growth sputtering. The tech heavy Nasdaq 100 dropped 7.3% this week, the most since 2015. Traders had already been bracing for the possibility of slowing expansion as the Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to further interest-rate increases after Wednesday’s hike. “There is a tug of war between Fed tightening, fiscal stimulus, strong earning but slowing sales and now tariffs and potential trade wars,” said Jason Browne, chief investment strategist at FundX Investment Group. Adding to the image of the ascendance of the “America first” faction, Trump replaced White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster with John Bolton, a controversial foreign-affairs specialist whom the US Senate declined to confirm as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations.
