The minister of finance has asked Davis Tax Committee chair Judge Dennis Davis, to appoint a panel of independent experts to review the current list of zero-rated food items, and “consider the most effective way to mitigate the impact of the increase in the VAT rate on poor and low-income households.” “The review will consider expanding the list of basic food items that are VAT zero-rated, and also consider how specific expenditure programmes can be improved to better target poor and low-income households (e.g. National School Nutrition Programme, food stamps etc.). This review process should be done within the confines of the current Fiscal Framework as proposed in the 2018 Budget, including for revenue and expenditure,” states National Treasury in a statement issued on Thursday. Professor Ingrid Woolard has been appointed to lead this process, with prominent experts. “The panel will take public comments, and convene hearings, and will engage with different stakeholders from civil society organisations, organised labour and business, and all interested parties. “The panel is expected to deliver an initial report with all the options and recommendations to the DTC and minister of finance by June 30 2018, in time to be considered by Cabinet for incorporation in the draft tax legislation that will be published in early July. Parliament will then consider the bills, and provide for its own public hearings.” The increase in the value-added tax (VAT) rate from 14 to 15% takes effect on April 1. “In order to ensure that VAT is not regressive, the current 19 zero-rate food items will continue to be zero-rated,” says Treasury.
