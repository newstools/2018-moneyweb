South African Airways chief executive officer Vuyani Jarana rejected a report that the state-owned carrier plans to fire at least 1 000 workers as it seeks to cut costs and return to profitability. “That’s not correct,” Jarana said in an interview on Monday with the Johannesburg-based 702 radio station. “We are not anywhere near close to getting to know how many people we need to retrench.” A report by the Johannesburg-based Sowetan newspaper cited a South African labour union as saying the national carrier intends to fire at least 1 000 people. SAA’s net loss widened more than threefold to R5.6 billion ($464 million) in the 2017 financial year and the company may not be able to operate as a going concern, South Africa’s Auditor-General said earlier this month. There’s no resolution to cut jobs, Jarana said. “When there are jobs to be on the line, the unions and myself will discuss.” © 2018 Bloomberg
