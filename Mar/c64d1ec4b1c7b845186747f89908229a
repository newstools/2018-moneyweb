South Africa Graft Inquiry to Summon Zuma’s Son, Gupta Brothers South African lawmakers said it will summon the Gupta family and the son of former President Jacob Zuma to appear before an inquiry that is investigating the mismanagement of public funds at state-owned enterprises. The former chairwoman of South African Airways, Dudu Myeni, will also be subpoenaed after failing to heed two invitations to give testimony at the hearings in Cape Town, parliament said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The inquiry is probing allegations that the Gupta brothers used their association with Duduzane Zuma to loot billions of rand from the government. The Guptas and Zuma all deny wrongdoing. The “issuing of summons is the last resort that the committee had to undertake as invitations have been issued without any success,” parliament said in the statement. “It would be impossible to finish the work of the inquiry without the testimony of Ms Myeni, including that of Mr Zuma and the Gupta family.” © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
