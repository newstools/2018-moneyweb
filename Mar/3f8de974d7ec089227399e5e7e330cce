South Africa’s rand steadied against the dollar early on Wednesday ahead of the central bank’s interest rate decision later in the day, with economists expecting the main lending rate to be cut. At 06:45 GMT, the rand traded at 11.67 per dollar, not far off its overnight close of 11.68. With the rand appreciating in recent months and consumer price inflation easing, economists expect the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) to cut its repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.50%, a Reuters poll said last week. “A rate cut now may be justified – further out, it is difficult to say whether conditions will be as conducive to providing a growth stimulus,” Standard Chartered Bank’s Chief Africa Economist Razia Khan said in a note. The Sarb’s press conference to announce the decision starts at 13:00 GMT. Stocks were set to open lower at 07:00 GMT, with the JSE securities exchange’s Top-40 futures index down 1.19%. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond was down 0.5 basis points to 7.885%, reflecting firmer bond prices.
