South Africa’s rand was little changed early on Friday, as traders refrained from taking large positions in the absence of domestic triggers while fears of a global trade war weighed on sentiment. At 0607 GMT, the rand traded at 11.89 versus the dollar, 0.02% softer from its overnight close in New York. “After having consolidated over the past week, the rand has failed to make any meaningful gains below 11.80 level, any forays toward the downside being met with dollar buying interest,” Nedbank said in note. Nedbank expects the currency to trade in the range of 11.80 to 12.10 on Friday. Government bonds were also flat, and the yield for the benchmark instrument due in 2026 was 8.130%.
