Former president Jacob Zuma was due to appear in court on April 6 to face charges of corruption in a years-old R29.2 billion arms deal, his lawyer said on Monday. Zumaâ€™s lawyer, Michael Hulley, said he received a court summons on behalf of his client on Monday. The National Prosecuting Authority earlier this month said it would seek to prosecute Zuma on 16 charges, including fraud, racketeering, corruption and money laundering.
