Reed Hastings is off to a good start in 2018. The 57-year-old Netflix founder has seen his wealth rise 47% so far this year to a record $4.1 billion on Friday, earning him a spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index of the world’s 500 richest people for the first time.  Netflix shares closed at a record last week as investors continued to cheer results for 2017 that shattered subscription-growth expectations. The percentage gain in Hastings’ fortune this year is more than double that of other tech tycoons including Amazon.com’s Jeff Bezos, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet’s Sergey Brin and Larry Page. © 2018 Bloomberg L.P
