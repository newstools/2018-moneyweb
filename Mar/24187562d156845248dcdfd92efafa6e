South African rand weakened on Wednesday along with other emerging markets as investors dumped risky assets after a key free trade advocate in the White House resigned, fanning fears U.S. President Donald Trump will trigger a trade war. Stocks were knocked by profit-taking in the banking sector after strong gains in the previous session. At 14:45 GMT, the rand traded 0.62% weaker at 11.79 per dollar, having hit a session-low of 11.92. While traders worry over the possible trade war, the scenario continues to favour long-rand bets, especially after Tuesday’s economic growth data surprised on the upside. The economy grew 3.1 percent in the October-December period against expectations of 1.8 percent. “This is good news in view of Moody’s rating review at the end of the month – as higher growth facilitates the urgently required consolidation of the public finances,” said analysts at German-based Commerzbank. “However, we are sceptical whether this high momentum is sustainable,” they said in a note. Traders said the rand would likely remain in a range between 11.50 and 11.95, with investors on the defensive and keeping an eye on the possible capital reversals if a trade war breaks out. In fixed income, the yield for the benchmark government bond due in 2026 was up one basis points to 8.12 percent. On the bourse, the benchmark Top-40 index weakened 0.48% to 52,005 points while the All-Share index lowered 0.47% to 58,962 points. The banking sector lost 1.6%, leading the bourse lower amid profit taking after the sector, which is usually seen as an economic barometer, ended higher on Tuesday on the back of the robust GDP data. “Yesterday we saw a bit of a push in some of the stocks so we are seeing a breather or bit of profit taking coming in here,” said Independent Securities trader Ryan Woods. FirstRand fell 4% to R71.94, Capitec Bank shed 1.8% to R851.65 and Standard Bank weakened 0.5% to R223.84.
