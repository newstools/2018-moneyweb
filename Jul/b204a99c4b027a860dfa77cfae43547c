Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by growth in bond trading and investment banking. The fifth-largest US bank by assets said net earnings applicable to shareholders rose to $2.35 billion, or $5.98 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $1.63 billion, or $3.95 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast earnings per share of $4.66, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data. Revenue from trading, its biggest business, rose 17% to $3.57 billion, as strength in commodities and interest rate products boosted fixed income trading revenue by 45%. Equities trading revenue, however, was unchanged from last year, in contrast with other big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup, which have reported increases. Total revenue rose 18.3% to $8.40 billion, with investment banking revenue rising 18%.
