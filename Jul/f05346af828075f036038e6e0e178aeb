US stocks slipped on Thursday after earnings disappointed and trade jitters intensified on fears that the European Union could slap retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. Officials from the EU Trade Commission are said to be preparing a list of tit-for-tat trade actions in response to proposed US tariffs on EU cars ahead of next week’s talks in Washington. Automakers said tariffs on US cars and car parts could raise vehicle prices by $83 billion annually. Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co were down 0.5% and 1.0%, respectively. “We’ve already started to feel the effect of the counter-tariffs,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. “No one’s ever won a multi-front war,” Pursche added. “And that’s what we’re engaging in right now.” Manufacturers in all 12 districts of the US Federal Reserve are worried about the impact of the trade dispute, according the central bank’s Beige Book report released on Wednesday. The dollar index briefly hit a one-year high, but pared its gains to trade near unchanged after President Donald Trump’s comments that the strong dollar “puts us at a disadvantage.” Shares of eBay fell 9.0% and the stock was among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 after disappointing results.

The second-quarter reporting period is picking up steam, with results in so far from 69 companies in the S&P 500. Earnings now are forecast to have risen 21.5%, compared with the 20.7% gain seen on July 1. Of the companies that have reported, 85.5% have surprised analyst estimates to the upside, according to Thomson Reuters data. The financial sector saw the biggest percentage drop in the S&P 500, down 1.1%. While all three major US stock indexes were in negative territory, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The US yield curve flattened close to levels not seen in 11 years, dragging on banks. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup were all down about 1%.
