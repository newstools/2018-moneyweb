Stephen van Coller will leave MTN Group at the end of August. Vice president for digital services, data analytics and business development, he has resigned to take up a group CEO position at another JSE-listed company. In a statement issued on the JSE’s stock exchange news service on Thursday, MTN Group CEO Rob Shuter said Van Coller’s successor will be announced “in due course”. The telecommunications group did not say which company he is joining. Van Coller joined MTN in October 2016 from Absa, where he was head of the Corporate and Investment Bank. Shuter said Van Coller “played an instrumental role in designing the new Bright strategy and ensuring its focus on building out the new digital services area”. Bright underpins MTN’s renewal and growth plans. “Under Stephen’s leadership, the mobile financial services customer base more than doubled to 25 million and significant progress has been made across the group in building big data analytics and rich-media services across music, video and gaming,” MTN said in the statement. In the 2017 financial year, Van Coller was paid R19.5-million by MTN. This included his salary of R7.7-million and R10.3-million in bonuses. This article was originally published on TechCentral here.
