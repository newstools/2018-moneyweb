South Africa’s jobless rate stayed near a 15-year high in the second quarter as factories shed jobs. The unemployment rate was 27.2% compared with 26.7% in the previous three months, Statistics South Africa said in a report released on Tuesday in the capital, Pretoria. The manufacturing industry lost the most jobs in the quarter, employing 105 000 less people than in the first three months of the year. Community and social-services, which includes the government, shed 93 000. Africa’s most-industrialised economy is struggling to create jobs as it hasn’t expanded at more than 2% since 2013. For the past two years, more than one in four people in the workforce has been unemployed. Per-capita economic growth has turned negative, and South Africa has the highest income inequality among nations measured by the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based lender said Monday.
