The ANC wants greater private investment in struggling state-owned power utility Eskom, Treasurer General Paul Mashatile said on Thursday. Mashatile also said the ruling party was holding discussions about splitting up Eskomâ€™s operations. He was speaking during a business breakfast on the sideline of a Brics summit in Johannesburg. Cash-strapped Eskom reported a R2.3 billion loss for the financial year which ended in March.
