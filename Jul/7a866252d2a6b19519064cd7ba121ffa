China’s commerce ministry said on Monday it had filed a complaint to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regarding Washington’s proposed tariff list on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 16. The Ministry of Commerce said last week China would immediately file a complaint to the WTO against US unilateralism, following the US’ threat to slap 10% tariffs on an extra $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.
