The rand fell around 1% against the dollar on Monday as struggling state-run power firm Eskom reported a R2.3 billion loss for the 2017/18 financial year. At 1522 GMT the rand was at 13.53 to the dollar, down 1.05%. The power utility, which supplies more than 90% of the country’s power and has around R270 billion of state-guaranteed debt, attributed the losses to increases in financing costs and depreciation of assets. “The Eskom results painted a very dire picture. The numbers show an ailing power utility, financial instability and a complete lack of direction in terms of whether this going forward is sustainable,” said Cheslyn Francis, derivatives trader at Afrifocus securities. “I think that is what the market is focusing on because electricity generation is an important part of any industrialised nation. Everybody will be watching the plans going forward for how they are going to navigate this.” In fixed income, the yield on benchmark paper due in 2026 was up 0.5 basis points at 8.775%.

Retailer Steinhoff extended Friday’s losses on profit taking, closing down 14.24% to R2.77.
