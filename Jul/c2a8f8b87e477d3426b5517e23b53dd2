Copper’s flashing a strong warning about expectations for global growth as US President Donald Trump fired the first shot in a global trade war by imposing tariffs on $34 billion of imports from China, which immediately said it would be forced to retaliate. The metal has lost more than $1 000 since closing at a four-year high of $7 332 a metric ton on June 7. The slump deepened on Friday, with prices down 1.5% to $6 249 on the London Metal Exchange by 12:47 pm in Singapore, set for the biggest weekly loss since 2015. “Copper has become the lightning rod for concerns about economic growth amid the rising trade dispute,” Australia & New Zealand Banking said in a report, while suggesting that even though there were signs of slowing expansion, the metal’s recent steep decline was overdone.

On Thursday, the LMEX Metals Index hit the lowest since August 2017, and all base metals lost ground on Friday. “We feel the market is oversold,” ANZ said, referring to copper. “Supply disruptions remain a threat, and shifts in China’s consumption patterns will see demand for refined copper remain strong. If trade tension subsides, we would expect copper prices to recovery strongly in the second half of 2018.” © 2018 Bloomberg
