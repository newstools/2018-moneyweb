Citigroup Inc’s quarterly profit topped Wall Street estimates on Friday, helped by strength in its consumer banking business in Mexico, North America and Asia. The third-largest US bank by assets, like its peers, also benefited from a cut in income tax rates and an expanding US economy that fueled demand for loans. Net income rose to $4.49 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $3.87 billion a year earlier, driven by a 14% jump in net income for its global consumer banking. Pretax profit from continuing operations increased 5%. Earnings per share rose to $1.63 from $1.28 and topped analysts’ average estimate of $1.56, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The bank’s provision for income tax fell by $351 million, following President Donald Trump’s corporate tax rate cuts. Buybacks reduced shares outstanding by 8% from a year earlier, further boosting earnings per share. Revenue rose about 2 percent to $18.47 billion but came in slightly below the average expectation of $18.51 billion as revenue from its investment banking business fell 7%. The bank’s fixed income trading revenue fell 6%, while equity trading revenue rose 19%. Total markets and securities services revenue fell 1%. Last month, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said he expected trading revenue to be “flattish” compared with a year earlier. Through Thursday, Citigroup shares are down 7.9% for the year, compared with the 1% drop in the broader KBW Bank Index. JPMorgan Chase & Co’s quarterly profit topped Wall Street’s expectations on Friday, as trading revenue came in much higher than expected and demand for loans increased on the back of a strengthening US economy.
