A South African court postponed hearings on Thursday in a culpable homicide case involving former president Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane until August 23. Lawyers for Duduzane Zuma said they hoped to agree on a start date once they had studied the state’s evidence. The charges relate to a fatal 2014 car crash in which Duduzane’s sports car smashed into a minibus taxi.
