Steinhoff’s creditors agreed to hold on their debt claims for three years, the embattled retailer said on Friday, throwing a lifeline for the South African retailer caught in the throes of an accounting scandal. The parties will now seek to implement the restructuring within three months, the retailer said in a statement. Steinhoff’s shares initially rose 3% in response to the news, but later pared its gains to trade down 1.69. It is fighting for survival after revealing multi-billion euro holes in its balance sheet that wiped more than 90% off its market value and forced it to sell assets to fund working capital.
