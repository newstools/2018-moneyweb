Shareholders of South Africa’s Steinhoff Africa Retail (Star) have approved changing the company’s name to Pepkor Holdings in a move to further distance the company from its crisis-hit parent, Steinhoff International . Parts of Star’s business were formally called Pepkor. The resolution to change the company’s name received 99.9% of votes from the shareholders present, Star said in a statement on Friday. Steinhoff International has been fighting for survival after revealing accounting irregularities which sent its shares tumbling and sparked panic about the credibility of Star’s own accounts.
