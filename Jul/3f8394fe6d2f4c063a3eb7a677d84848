Sub-Saharan Africa has Nigeria to thank for better economic growth prospects next year. The region’s economy will probably expand 3.8% in 2019, the International Monetary Fund said in its World Economic Outlook update released Monday. That compares with a 3.7% prediction in April. The upgraded forecast “reflects improved prospects for Nigeria’s economy” and an increase in commodity prices. Gross domestic product in Africa’s most-populous nation will probably rise 2.3%, it said, lifting its estimate from 1.9% in April. Nigeria’s economy is recovering from the worst contraction in 25 years in 2016, which was caused by lower oil prices and output and shortages of foreign exchange to import raw materials.

South Africa, the continent’s most-industrialised economy, hasn’t grown at more than 2% a year since 2013. GDP shrank the most in almost a decade in the first quarter as former President Jacob Zuma handed the reins to Cyril Ramaphosa. Zuma spent close to nine years in power, during which time the nation lost its investment-grade credit rating and policy uncertainty and unemployment increased. Nigeria and South Africa’s economies account for about half of the region’s GDP.
