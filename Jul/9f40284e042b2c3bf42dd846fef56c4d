Steinhoff Retail Africa (Star) management has obtained an urgent court order against four senior members of the previous Tekkie Town management team interdicting them interfering with the Tekkie Town Information Technology System and destabilising operations. The relationship between Tekkie Town’s management and Star management has broken down irreparably with Tekkie Town founder Braam van Huysteen taking steps to launch a rival to Tekkie Town. The four interdicted individuals are Van Huysteen, CEO Bernard Mostert, Willem Wait and Anton Roetz. “It is regrettable that we have had to take such legal action,” says Star CEO Leon Lourens. “We remain focused on the continued success of Star and Tekkie Town and will focus on continued growth. Our ethics and values have never changed and never will. We will continue to use the necessary legal process available to protect our business. “The interim management and support team, together with staff members who have remained in the business, continue to operate Tekkie Town in a stable manner. The supply chain is operational, all stores are trading and performance is in line with targeted levels. The performance of all other Star businesses remains unaffected”. To be updated.
