Namibia’s economy will grow by 0.6% in 2018 and by more than double that in 2019, the central bank said on Friday, following a recession in the southern African nation last year. The Bank of Namibia said gross domestic product (GDP) would be supported by a recovery across most sectors and particularly in manufacturing and mining, while slower growth in neighbouring South Africa was one of the risks to the outlook.
