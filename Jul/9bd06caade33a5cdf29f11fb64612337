Workers at Randgold Resources’ Tongon gold mine in Ivory Coast went on strike over the weekend as government-led negotiations broke down, the company said in a statement on Monday. Randgold said it continued to work with Ivorian authorities and the workers’ unions to resolve the standoff, without giving any details about what it was about.
