Investors had long waited to see where Glencore’s serial dealmaker Ivan Glasenberg would turn his firepower next. The answer was revealed on Thursday: Glencore’s own battered shares. The company will spend up to $1 billion buying back its own shares before the end of the year. The announcement came two days after a plunge in Glencore shares, sparked by news that the US is investigating the company’s dealings in Africa and South America. Analysts said the buyback plan made major acquisitions by Glencore less likely in the near future.

Credit Suisse Group analysts highlighted that the buyback would bring the company’s net debt level closer to a self-imposed ceiling of $16 billion, “which should diminish the likelihood of any major M&A activity” in the next six months. While Glencore rebounded 3% to 329.05 pence on Thursday, the stock is still down almost 20% this year. To be sure, it’s impossible to rule out M&A from Glencore, one of the most active dealmakers in the natural resources industry. In February, Glasenberg highlighted the company’s appetite for acquisitions and substantial cash flow after the rally in commodity prices.

That may be unwelcome news for shareholders of Bunge, which has been seen as a likely target after Glencore made an informal approach last year. Bunge shares dropped to a six-month low this week.
