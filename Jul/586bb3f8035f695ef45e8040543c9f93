Coca-Cola is getting a boost from its healthier beverages, with its resurgent zero-sugar soda brands buoying the company’s results. Profit beat analysts’ estimates in the second quarter, helped by double-digit growth for its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar brand and efforts to cut costs, it said in a statement. The results drove the shares up as much as 1.7% in early trading Wednesday. The soda giant has been slimming down under Chief Executive Officer James Quincey, who has increased cost-cutting efforts since taking the helm last year. Coke has also focused on healthier beverages aimed at consumers trying to cut down on sugar. Even as US consumers move away from artificial sweeteners, the company has benefited from sales gains in Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Source: Beverage-Digest Profit amounted to 61 cents a share, excluding some items, beat the average estimate of 60 cents. Adjusted operating revenue was $8.9 billion, compared with projections for $8.54 billion. For years, the company has been selling off the bottlers it owned in order to refocus on becoming a marketing and formulation company. Though it remains the third-largest carbonated soft drink in the US, Diet Coke saw volume drop 4.3% last year, according to industry publication Beverage-Digest. In January, Coke launched the biggest-ever makeover for its original zero-calorie brand, releasing classic Diet Coke and four new flavours in taller, skinnier cans, spurring the American rebound. New flavours made up about a third of the brand’s growth. Quincey, 53, has pushed Coke to grow beyond its namesake brand to become a “total beverage company.” The strategy continues efforts that began under predecessor Muhtar Kent. This has included investing in startup beverage makers in the search for its next $1 billion brand. Quincey has been trimming costs, extending a productivity push started by Kent. Since becoming CEO last year, Quincey vowed to cut expenses by an additional $800 million. © 2018 Bloomberg
