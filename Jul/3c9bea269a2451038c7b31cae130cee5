Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) flagged a more than 350% increase in half-year profit boosted by improved operational performance and a more favourable rand basket price for the metal. Amplats said it expects headline earnings per share (Heps) to come in between 1 249 cents and 1 302 cents per share for the six months ended June 30, compared with 285 cents per share a year earlier. Heps is the main profit measure used in South Africa that strips out certain one-off items.
