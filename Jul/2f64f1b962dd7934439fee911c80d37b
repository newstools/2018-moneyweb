Bharti Airtel’s Kenyan unit gained subscribers for a second consecutive quarter as rivals including the nation’s biggest operator, Safaricom, relinquished market share, according to the industry regulator. Airtel’s subscribers increased by 19% to 8.7 million in the three months through March, which drove its mobile-money transactions, data, voice and SMS traffic higher, the Communications Authority said in a report emailed Wednesday from the capital, Nairobi. While Safaricom’s customers were steady at 29.5 million, the company shed 2 percentage points of market share to 67%, the CA said. Airtel’s portion grew to 19.7% from 17.2%.  Airtel’s active mobile-money users grew 22% to 3.39 million from the previous quarter, while the value of transactions grew to 1.88 billion shillings ($18.7 million). Safaricom’s mobile-money platform, known as M-Pesa, accounted for almost 80% of the 1.87 trillion shillings transacted in the quarter.
