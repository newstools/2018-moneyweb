Two United Arab Emirates airlines have held talks with South African Airways, which has said it urgently needs partners to revive its business, City Press reports, citing Mahash Alhameli, the UAE ambassador to South Africa.

Etihad Airways has also been holding separate negotiations with SAA, he said. “It’s company-to-company talks,” Alhameli said, according to the newspaper. “As ambassador, I’m facilitating that.” The UAE plans to invest as much as $10 billion in South Africa’s economy, a commitment made during a visit by the nation’s President Cyril Ramaphosa’s visit this month.
