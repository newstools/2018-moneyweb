The South African Weather Service said on Tuesday the likelihood of an El Nino weather pattern was increasing as the country moved towards spring, which normally starts in September, but it was too early to determine the potential impact. The last El Nino was linked to a severe drought that hit crop production and economic growth across southern Africa, and the region is still emerging from its affects two years later.
