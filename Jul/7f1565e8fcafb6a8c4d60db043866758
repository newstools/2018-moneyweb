Google officials will have an 11th-hour conference call with the European Union’s competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager Tuesday ahead of a potentially record fine, according to two people familiar with the matter. Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai will speak with Vestager by phone for a so-called state of play meeting, according to one of the people, who asked not to be named because the discussion is private. The European Commission fine, set for Wednesday, will top last year’s record €2.4 billion($2.8 billion) penalty in Google’s shopping-search investigation, one of the people said. EU officials have been investigating Google contracts that require manufacturers of Android phones to take a bundle of the company’s services when they want to license the Play app store. National competition authorities met earlier Tuesday to agree on the fine, one person said. Google and the commission declined to comment. © 2018 Bloomberg
