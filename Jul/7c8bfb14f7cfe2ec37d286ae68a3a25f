The rand retreated on Wednesday after the United States threatened to impose tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, cooling risk demand that had seen the currency rally to its best in three weeks. At 0700 GMT the rand was 0.58% weaker at 13.40 per dollar compared with the close of 13.33 overnight in New York. The surprise move by the United States reignited fears of a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies that risks derailing a global economic recovery. Emerging currencies suffered across the board, with investors opting for safer bets after the first half of the week had seen sentiment slightly favour riskier assets. As a result the dollar rose 0.1% in early trade against a basket of currencies. Analysts said the rand would trade cautiously in a narrow range between 13.30 and 13.60.
