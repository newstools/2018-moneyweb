Consumer confidence in South Africa dipped slightly in the second quarter, but remained “extraordinarily high” in the face of a weak economy, a survey found on Tuesday. The consumer confidence index (CCI) compiled by the Bureau for Economic Research fell to +22 in the second quarter from +26 in the first quarter, pushing it further below the 50-mark separating the net positive and negative territories. But the researchers said that was a strong performance given the current circumstances, and they would have typically expected a “negative correction” after the index saw its biggest single quarter rise in the first quarter. “This time around, consumer confidence remained extraordinarily high – and this in the face of a generally weak economy and significant drop in business confidence levels during the second quarter,” the report said. Mamello Matikinca, chief economist of South Africa’s First National Bank (FNB), which sponsored the report, said the figures had come in the face of several adverse developments in recent months, such as petrol price hikes between March and June, higher personal income taxes from the end of March and an increase in the valued-added tax (VAT) rate in April. The slight fall in consumer confidence followed a 6-point drop in a South African business confidence index, a reminder of the challenges faced by President Cyril Ramaphosa who has promised to deliver long term economic growth. The survey showed that the dramatic rebound in consumer sentiment during the first quarter of 2018 came on the back of massive jumps in all three sub-indices of the CCI.
